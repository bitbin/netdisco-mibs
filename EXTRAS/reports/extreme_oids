.1.0.8802.1.1.2.0.0.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpRemTablesChange,,,,,,A lldpRemTablesChange notification is sent when the value of lldpStatsRemTableLastChangeTime changes. It can be utilized by an NMS to trigger LLDP remote systems table maintenance polls. Note that transmission of lldpRemTablesChange notifications are throttled by the agent, as specified by the 'lldpNotificationInterval' object.

.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpConfiguration,,,,,,
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpMessageTxInterval,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The interval at which LLDP frames are transmitted on behalf of this LLDP agent. The default value for lldpMessageTxInterval object is 30 seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 30 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.2,LLDP-MIB::lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The time-to-live value expressed as a multiple of the lldpMessageTxInterval object. The actual time-to-live value used in LLDP frames, transmitted on behalf of this LLDP agent, can be expressed by the following formula: TTL = min(65535, (lldpMessageTxInterval * lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier)) For example, if the value of lldpMessageTxInterval is '30', and the value of lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier is '4', then the value '120' is encoded in the TTL field in the LLDP header. The default value for lldpMessageTxHoldMultiplier object is 4. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 4 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.3,LLDP-MIB::lldpReinitDelay,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The lldpReinitDelay indicates the delay (in units of seconds) from when lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object of a particular port becomes 'disabled' until re-initialization will be attempted. The default value for lldpReintDelay object is two seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 2 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.4,LLDP-MIB::lldpTxDelay,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The lldpTxDelay indicates the delay (in units of seconds) between successive LLDP frame transmissions  initiated by value/status changes in the LLDP local systems MIB. The recommended value for the lldpTxDelay is set by the following formula: 1 <= lldpTxDelay <= (0.25 * lldpMessageTxInterval) The default value for lldpTxDelay object is two seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 2 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.5,LLDP-MIB::lldpNotificationInterval,Integer32,read-write,,current,,This object controls the transmission of LLDP notifications. the agent must not generate more than one lldpRemTablesChange notification-event in the indicated period, where a 'notification-event' is the transmission of a single notification PDU type to a list of notification destinations. If additional changes in lldpRemoteSystemsData object groups occur within the indicated throttling period, then these trap- events must be suppressed by the agent. An NMS should periodically check the value of lldpStatsRemTableLastChangeTime to detect any missed lldpRemTablesChange notification-events, e.g. due to throttling or transmission loss. If notification transmission is enabled for particular ports, the suggested default throttling period is 5 seconds. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { 5 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table that controls LLDP frame transmission on individual ports.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigEntry,,not-accessible,lldpPortConfigPortNum,current,,LLDP configuration information for a particular port. This configuration parameter controls the transmission and the reception of LLDP frames on those ports whose rows are created in this table.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigPortNum,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value used to identify the port component (contained in the local chassis with the LLDP agent) associated with this entry. The value of this object is used as a port index to the lldpPortConfigTable.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6.1.2,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigAdminStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,current,txOnly(1):rxOnly(2):txAndRx(3):disabled(4),The administratively desired status of the local LLDP agent. If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'txOnly(1)', then LLDP agent will transmit LLDP frames on this port and it will not store any information about the remote systems connected.  If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'rxOnly(2)', then the LLDP agent will receive, but it will not transmit LLDP frames on this port. If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'txAndRx(3)', then the LLDP agent will transmit and receive LLDP frames on this port. If the associated lldpPortConfigAdminStatus object has a value of 'disabled(4)', then LLDP agent will not transmit or receive LLDP frames on this port. If there is remote systems information which is received on this port and stored in other tables, before the port's lldpPortConfigAdminStatus becomes disabled, then the information will naturally age out. DEFVAL { txAndRx }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6.1.3,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigNotificationEnable,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),The lldpPortConfigNotificationEnable controls, on a per port basis, whether or not notifications from the agent are enabled. The value true(1) means that notifications are enabled; the value false(2) means that they are not. DEFVAL { false }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.6.1.4,LLDP-MIB::lldpPortConfigTLVsTxEnable,BITS,read-write,,current,portDesc(0):sysName(1):sysDesc(2):sysCap(3),The lldpPortConfigTLVsTxEnable, defined as a bitmap, includes the basic set of LLDP TLVs whose transmission is allowed on the local LLDP agent by the network management. Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to a TLV type associated with a specific optional TLV. It should be noted that the organizationally-specific TLVs are excluded from the lldpTLVsTxEnable bitmap.  LLDP Organization Specific Information Extension MIBs should have similar configuration object to control transmission of their organizationally defined TLVs. The bit 'portDesc(0)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'Port Description TLV'. The bit 'sysName(1)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'System Name TLV'. The bit 'sysDesc(2)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'System Description TLV'. The bit 'sysCap(3)' indicates that LLDP agent should transmit 'System Capabilities TLV'. There is no bit reserved for the management address TLV type since transmission of management address TLVs are controlled by another object, lldpConfigManAddrTable. The default value for lldpPortConfigTLVsTxEnable object is empty set, which means no enumerated values are set. The value of this object must be restored from non-volatile storage after a re-initialization of the management system. DEFVAL { { } }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.7,LLDP-MIB::lldpConfigManAddrTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table that controls selection of LLDP management address TLV instances to be transmitted on individual ports.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.7.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpConfigManAddrEntry,,not-accessible,,current,,LLDP configuration information that specifies the set of ports (represented as a PortList) on which the local system management address instance will be transmitted. This configuration object augments the lldpLocManAddrEntry, therefore it is only present along with the management address instance contained in the associated lldpLocManAddrEntry entry. Each active lldpConfigManAddrEntry must be restored from non-volatile and re-created (along with the corresponding lldpLocManAddrEntry) after a re-initialization of the management system.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.1.7.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpConfigManAddrPortsTxEnable,OCTET,read-write,,current,,A set of ports that are identified by a PortList, in which each port is represented as a bit. The corresponding local system management address instance will be transmitted on the member ports of the lldpManAddrPortsTxEnable.  The default value for lldpConfigManAddrPortsTxEnable object is empty binary string, which means no ports are specified for advertising indicated management address instance. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatistics,,,,,,
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRemTablesLastChangeTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime object (defined in IETF RFC 3418) at the time an entry is created, modified, or deleted in the in tables associated with the lldpRemoteSystemsData objects and all LLDP extension objects associated with remote systems. An NMS can use this object to reduce polling of the lldpRemoteSystemsData objects.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.2,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRemTablesInserts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP has been inserted into tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects. The complete set of information received from a particular MSAP should be inserted into related tables. If partial information cannot be inserted for a reason such as lack of resources, all of the complete set of information should be removed. This counter should be incremented only once after the complete set of information is successfully recorded in all related tables. Any failures during inserting information set which result in deletion of previously inserted information should not trigger any changes in lldpStatsRemTablesInserts since the insert is not completed yet or or in lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes, since the deletion would only be a partial deletion. If the failure was the result of lack of resources, the lldpStatsRemTablesDrops counter should be incremented once.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.3,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP has been deleted from tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects. This counter should be incremented only once when the complete set of information is completely deleted from all related tables. Partial deletions, such as deletion of rows associated with a particular MSAP from some tables, but not from all tables are not allowed, thus should not change the value of this counter.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.4,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRemTablesDrops,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP could not be entered into tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects because of insufficient resources.

This counter should be incremented only once when the complete set of information is completely invalidated (aged out) from all related tables. Partial aging, similar to deletion case, is not allowed, and thus, should not change the value of this counter.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.6,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsTxPortTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table containing LLDP transmission statistics for individual ports. Entries are not required to exist in this table while the lldpPortConfigEntry object is equal to 'disabled(4)'.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.6.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsTxPortEntry,,not-accessible,lldpStatsTxPortNum,current,,LLDP frame transmission statistics for a particular port.  The port must be contained in the same chassis as the LLDP agent.  All counter values in a particular entry shall be maintained on a continuing basis and shall not be deleted upon expiration of rxInfoTTL timing counters in the LLDP remote systems MIB of the receipt of a shutdown frame from a remote LLDP agent. All statistical counters associated with a particular port on the local LLDP agent become frozen whenever the adminStatus is disabled for the same port.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.6.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsTxPortNum,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value used to identify the port component (contained in the local chassis with the LLDP agent) associated with this entry. The value of this object is used as a port index to the lldpStatsTable.

.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.7.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRxPortEntry,,not-accessible,lldpStatsRxPortNum,current,,LLDP frame reception statistics for a particular port. The port must be contained in the same chassis as the LLDP agent.  All counter values in a particular entry shall be maintained on a continuing basis and shall not be deleted upon expiration of rxInfoTTL timing counters in the LLDP remote systems MIB of the receipt of a shutdown frame from a remote LLDP agent. All statistical counters associated with a particular port on the local LLDP agent become frozen whenever the adminStatus is disabled for the same port.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.7.1.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRxPortNum,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index value used to identify the port component (contained in the local chassis with the LLDP agent) associated with this entry. The value of this object is used as a port index to the lldpStatsTable.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.7.1.2,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRxPortFramesDiscardedTotal,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of LLDP frames received by this LLDP agent on the indicated port, and then discarded for any reason. This counter can provide an indication that LLDP header formating problems may exist with the local LLDP agent in the sending system or that LLDPDU validation problems may exist with the local LLDP agent in the receiving system.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.7.1.3,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRxPortFramesErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of invalid LLDP frames received by this LLDP agent on the indicated port, while this LLDP agent is enabled.

.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.7.1.6,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRxPortTLVsUnrecognizedTotal,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of LLDP TLVs received on the given port that are not recognized by this LLDP agent on the indicated port.  An unrecognized TLV is referred to as the TLV whose type value is in the range of reserved TLV types (000 1001 - 111 1110) in Table 9.1 of IEEE Std 802.1AB-2005. An unrecognized TLV may be a basic management TLV from a later LLDP version.
.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.2.7.1.7,LLDP-MIB::lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The counter that represents the number of age-outs that occurred on a given port. An age-out is the number of times the complete set of information advertised by a particular MSAP has been deleted from tables contained in lldpRemoteSystemsData and lldpExtensions objects because the information timeliness interval has expired. This counter is similar to lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts, except that the counter is on a per port basis. This enables NMS to poll tables associated with the lldpRemoteSystemsData objects and all LLDP extension objects associated with remote systems on the indicated port only. This counter should be set to zero during agent initialization and its value should not be saved in non-volatile storage. When a port's admin status changes from 'disabled' to 'rxOnly', 'txOnly' or 'txAndRx', the counter associated with the same port should reset to 0. The agent should also flush all remote system information associated with the same port. This counter should be incremented only once when the complete set of information is invalidated (aged out) from all related tables on a particular port. Partial aging is not allowed, and thus, should not change the value of this counter.

.1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.4.1,LLDP-MIB::lldpRemTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one or more rows per physical network connection known to this agent. The agent may wish to ensure that only one lldpRemEntry is present for each local port, or it may choose to maintain multiple lldpRemEntries for the same local port. The following procedure may be used to retrieve remote systems information updates from an LLDP agent: 1. NMS polls all tables associated with remote systems and keeps a local copy of the information retrieved. NMS polls periodically the values of the following objects: a. lldpStatsRemTablesInserts b. lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes c. lldpStatsRemTablesDrops d. lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts e. lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal for all ports. 2. LLDP agent updates remote systems MIB objects, and sends out notifications to a list of notification destinations. 3. NMS receives the notifications and compares the new values of objects listed in step 1.  Periodically, NMS should poll the object lldpStatsRemTablesLastChangeTime to find out if anything has changed since the last poll. if something has changed, NMS will poll the objects listed in step 1 to figure out what kind of changes occurred in the tables. if value of lldpStatsRemTablesInserts has changed, then NMS will walk all tables by employing TimeFilter with the last-polled time value. This request will return new objects or objects whose values are updated since the last poll. if value of lldpStatsRemTablesAgeouts has changed, then NMS will walk the lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal and compare the new values with previously recorded ones. For ports whose lldpStatsRxPortAgeoutsTotal value is greater than the recorded value, NMS will have to retrieve objects associated with those ports from table(s) without employing a TimeFilter (which is performed by specifying 0 for the TimeFilter.) lldpStatsRemTablesDeletes and lldpStatsRemTablesDrops objects are provided for informational purposes.

For example, if the interface is realized by an ethernet, then the value of this object refers to a document defining objects specific to ethernet. If this information is not present, its value should be set to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER { 0 0 }, which is a syntatically valid object identifier, and any conformant implementation of ASN.1 and BER must be able to generate and recognize this value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::at,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1,RFC1213-MIB::atTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,The Address Translation tables contain the NetworkAddress to `physical' address equivalences. Some interfaces do not use translation tables for determining address equivalences (e.g., DDN-X.25 has an algorithmic method); if all interfaces are of this type, then the Address Translation table is empty, i.e., has zero entries.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::atPhysAddress,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The media-dependent `physical' address. Setting this object to a null string (one of zero length) has the effect of invaliding the corresponding entry in the atTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use. Proper interpretation of such entries requires examination of the relevant atPhysAddress object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.3.1.1.3,RFC1213-MIB::atNetAddress,NetworkAddress,read-write,,deprecated,,The NetworkAddress (e.g., the IP address) corresponding to the media-dependent `physical' address.

IP gateways forward datagrams. IP hosts do not (except those source-routed via the host). Note that for some managed nodes, this object may take on only a subset of the values possible. Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to change this object to an inappropriate value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.2,RFC1213-MIB::ipDefaultTTL,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The default value inserted into the Time-To-Live field of the IP header of datagrams originated at this entity, whenever a TTL value is not supplied by the transport layer protocol.

This count includes invalid addresses (e.g., 0.0.0.0) and addresses of unsupported Classes (e.g., Class E). For entities which are not IP Gateways and therefore do not forward datagrams, this counter includes datagrams discarded because the destination address was not a local address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.6,RFC1213-MIB::ipForwDatagrams,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of input datagrams for which this entity was not their final IP destination, as a result of which an attempt was made to find a route to forward them to that final destination. In entities which do not act as IP Gateways, this counter will include only those packets which were Source-Routed via this entity, and the Source- Route option processing was successful.

Note that this counter would include datagrams counted in ipForwDatagrams if any such packets met this (discretionary) discard criterion.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.12,RFC1213-MIB::ipOutNoRoutes,Counter32,read-only,,mandatory,,The number of IP datagrams discarded because no route could be found to transmit them to their destination. Note that this counter includes any packets counted in ipForwDatagrams which meet this `no-route' criterion. Note that this includes any datagarms which a host cannot route because all of its default gateways are down.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.13,RFC1213-MIB::ipReasmTimeout,INTEGER,read-only,,mandatory,,The maximum number of seconds which received fragments are held while they are awaiting reassembly at this entity.

Note that this is not necessarily a count of discarded IP fragments since some algorithms (notably the algorithm in RFC 815) can lose track of the number of fragments by combining them as they are received.

For example, when the Internet standard all-ones broadcast address is used, the value will be 1. This value applies to both the subnet and network broadcasts addresses used by the entity on this (logical) interface.

Multiple routes to a single destination can appear in the table, but access to such multiple entries is dependent on the table- access mechanisms defined by the network management protocol in use.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.21.1.2,RFC1213-MIB::ipRouteIfIndex,INTEGER,read-write,,mandatory,,The index value which uniquely identifies the local interface through which the next hop of this route should be reached.

Note that the values direct(3) and indirect(4) refer to the notion of direct and indirect routing in the IP architecture. Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipRouteTable object. That is, it effectively dissasociates the destination identified with said entry from the route identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table.

For those systems that do not support arbitrary subnet masks, an agent constructs the value of the ipRouteMask by determining whether the value of the correspondent ipRouteDest field belong to a class-A, B, or C network, and then using one of: mask network 255.0.0.0 class-A 255.255.0.0 class-B 255.255.255.0 class-C If the value of the ipRouteDest is 0.0.0.0 (a default route), then the mask value is also 0.0.0.0.

Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the ipNetToMediaTable. That is, it effectively dissasociates the interface identified with said entry from the mapping identified with said entry. It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether the agent removes an invalidated entry from the table. Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to receive tabular information from agents that corresponds to entries not currently in use.

The only value which may be set by a management station is deleteTCB(12). Accordingly, it is appropriate for an agent to return a `badValue' response if a management station attempts to set this object to any other value. If a management station sets this object to the value deleteTCB(12), then this has the effect of deleting the TCB (as defined in RFC 793) of the corresponding connection on the managed node, resulting in immediate termination of the connection. As an implementation-specific option, a RST segment may be sent from the managed node to the other TCP endpoint (note however that RST segments are not sent reliably).

Thus, only seven bits per chan- nel, or 1.344 Mbps, is available for data. dsx1B8ZS refers to the use of a specified pat- tern of normal bits and bipolar violations which are used to replace a sequence of eight zero bits. ANSI Clear Channels may use dsx1ZBTSI, or Zero Byte Time Slot Interchange. E1 links, with or without CRC, use dsx1HDB3 or dsx1AMI. dsx1AMI refers to a mode wherein no zero code suppression is present and the line encoding does not solve the problem directly. In this application, the higher layer must provide data which meets or exceeds the pulse density re- quirements, such as inverting HDLC data.

Agents support- ing read/write access should return badValue in response to a requested loopback state that the interface does not support. The values mean: dsx1NoLoop Not in the loopback state. A device that is not capable of performing a loopback on the interface shall always return this as it's value. dsx1PayloadLoop The received signal at this interface is looped through the device. Typically the received signal is looped back for re- transmission after it has passed through the device's framing function. dsx1LineLoop The received signal at this interface does not go through the device (minimum pene- tration) but is looped back out. dsx1OtherLoop Loopbacks that are not defined here.

It contains loopback, failure, re- ceived 'alarm' and transmitted 'alarm' infor- mation. The dsx1LineStatus is a bit map represented as a sum, therefore, it can represent multiple failures (alarms) and a LoopbackState simultaneously. dsx1NoAlarm should be set if and only if no other flag is set. If the dsx1LoopbackState bit is set, the loopback in ef- fect can be determined from the dsx1LoopbackConfig object. The various bit positions are: 1 dsx1NoAlarm No Alarm Present 2 dsx1RcvFarEndLOF Far end LOF (a.k.a., Yellow Alarm) 4 dsx1XmtFarEndLOF Near end sending LOF Indication 8 dsx1RcvAIS Far end sending AIS 16 dsx1XmtAIS Near end sending AIS 32 dsx1LossOfFrame Near end LOF (a.k.a., Red Alarm) 64 dsx1LossOfSignal Near end Loss Of Signal 128 dsx1LoopbackState Near end is looped 256 dsx1T16AIS E1 TS16 AIS 512 dsx1RcvFarEndLOMF Far End Sending TS16 LOMF 1024 dsx1XmtFarEndLOMF Near End Sending TS16 LOMF 2048 dsx1RcvTestCode Near End detects a test code 4096 dsx1OtherFailure any line status not defined here

The values mean: dsx3NoLoop Not in the loopback state. A device that is not capable of performing a loopback on the interface shall always return this as its value. dsx3PayloadLoop The received signal at this interface is looped through the device. Typically the received signal is looped back for retransmission after it has passed through the device's framing function. dsx3LineLoop The received signal at this interface does not go through the device (minimum penetration) but is looped back out. dsx3OtherLoop Loopbacks that are not defined here. dsx3InwardLoop The sent signal at this interface is looped back through the device. dsx3DualLoop Both dsx1LineLoop and dsx1InwardLoop will be active simultaneously.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.0,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsLsrNotifications,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.0.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsXCUp,,,,,,This notification is generated when the mplsXCOperStatus object for one or more contiguous entries in mplsXCTable are about to enter the up(1) state from some other state. The included values of mplsXCOperStatus MUST both be set equal to this new state (i.e: up(1)). The two instances of mplsXCOperStatus in this notification indicate the range of indexes that are affected. Note that all the indexes of the two ends of the range can be derived from the instance identifiers of these two objects. For cases where a contiguous range of cross-connects have transitioned into the up(1) state at roughly the same time, the device SHOULD issue a single notification for each range of contiguous indexes in an effort to minimize the emission of a large number of notifications. If a notification has to be issued for just a single cross-connect entry, then the instance identifier (and values) of the two mplsXCOperStatus objects MUST be the identical.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.0.2,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsXCDown,,,,,,This notification is generated when the mplsXCOperStatus object for one or more contiguous entries in mplsXCTable are about to enter the down(2) state from some other state. The included values of mplsXCOperStatus MUST both be set equal to this down(2) state. The two instances of mplsXCOperStatus in this notification indicate the range of indexes that are affected. Note that all the indexes of the two ends of the range can be derived from the instance identifiers of these two objects. For cases where a contiguous range of cross-connects have transitioned into the down(2) state at roughly the same time, the device SHOULD issue a single notification for each range of contiguous indexes in an effort to minimize the emission of a large number of notifications. If a notification has to be issued for just a single cross-connect entry, then the instance identifier (and values) of the two mplsXCOperStatus objects MUST be identical.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsLsrObjects,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfaceTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table specifies per-interface MPLS capability and associated information.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.1.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfaceEntry,,not-accessible,mplsInterfaceIndex,current,,A conceptual row in this table is created automatically by an LSR for every interface capable of supporting MPLS and which is configured to do so. A conceptual row in this table will exist if and only if a corresponding entry in ifTable exists with ifType = mpls(166). If this associated entry in ifTable is operationally disabled (thus removing MPLS capabilities on that interface), the corresponding entry in this table MUST be deleted shortly thereafter. An conceptual row with index 0 is created if the LSR supports per-platform labels. This conceptual row represents the per-platform label space and contains parameters that apply to all interfaces that participate in the per-platform label space. Other conceptual rows in this table represent MPLS interfaces that may participate in either the per-platform or per- interface label spaces, or both. Implementations that either only support per-platform labels, or have only them configured, may choose to return just the mplsInterfaceEntry of 0 and not return the other rows. This will greatly reduce the number of objects returned. Further information about label space participation of an interface is provided in the DESCRIPTION clause of mplsInterfaceLabelParticipationType.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.1.1.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfaceIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,This is a unique index for an entry in the MplsInterfaceTable. A non-zero index for an entry indicates the ifIndex for the corresponding interface entry of the MPLS-layer in the ifTable. The entry with index 0 represents the per-platform label space and contains parameters that apply to all interfaces that participate in the per-platform label space. Other entries defined in this table represent additional MPLS interfaces that may participate in either the per-platform or per-interface label spaces, or both.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.1.1.2,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfaceLabelMinIn,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,This is the minimum value of an MPLS label that this LSR is willing to receive on this interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.1.1.3,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfaceLabelMaxIn,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,This is the maximum value of an MPLS label that this LSR is willing to receive on this interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.1.1.4,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfaceLabelMinOut,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,This is the minimum value of an MPLS label that this LSR is willing to send on this interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.1.1.5,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfaceLabelMaxOut,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,This is the maximum value of an MPLS label that this LSR is willing to send on this interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.1.1.6,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfaceTotalBandwidth,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,This value indicates the total amount of usable bandwidth on this interface and is specified in kilobits per second (Kbps). This variable is not applicable when applied to the interface with index 0. When this value cannot be measured, this value should contain the nominal bandwidth.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.1.1.7,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfaceAvailableBandwidth,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,This value indicates the total amount of available bandwidth available on this interface and is specified in kilobits per second (Kbps). This value is calculated as the difference between the amount of bandwidth currently in use and that specified in mplsInterfaceTotalBandwidth. This variable is not applicable when applied to the interface with index 0. When this value cannot be measured, this value should contain the nominal bandwidth.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.1.1.8,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfaceLabelParticipationType,BITS,read-only,,current,perPlatform(0):perInterface(1),If the value of the mplsInterfaceIndex for this entry is zero, then this entry corresponds to the per-platform label space for all interfaces configured to use that label space. In this case the perPlatform(0) bit MUST be set; the perInterface(1) bit is meaningless and MUST be ignored. The remainder of this description applies to entries with a non-zero value of mplsInterfaceIndex. If the perInterface(1) bit is set then the value of mplsInterfaceLabelMinIn, mplsInterfaceLabelMaxIn, mplsInterfaceLabelMinOut, and mplsInterfaceLabelMaxOut for this entry reflect the label ranges for this interface. If only the perPlatform(0) bit is set, then the value of mplsInterfaceLabelMinIn, mplsInterfaceLabelMaxIn, mplsInterfaceLabelMinOut, and mplsInterfaceLabelMaxOut for this entry MUST be identical to the instance of these objects with index 0. These objects may only vary from the entry with index 0 if both the perPlatform(0) and perInterface(1) bits are set. In all cases, at a minimum one of the perPlatform(0) or perInterface(1) bits MUST be set to indicate that at least one label space is in use by this interface. In all cases, agents MUST ensure that label ranges are specified consistently and MUST return an inconsistentValue error when they do not.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.2,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfacePerfTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table provides MPLS performance information on a per-interface basis.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.2.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfacePerfEntry,,not-accessible,,current,,An entry in this table is created by the LSR for every interface capable of supporting MPLS. Its is an extension to the mplsInterfaceEntry table. Note that the discontinuity behavior of entries in this table MUST be based on the corresponding ifEntry's ifDiscontinuityTime.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.2.1.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfacePerfInLabelsInUse,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,This object counts the number of labels that are in use at this point in time on this interface in the incoming direction. If the interface participates in only the per-platform label space, then the value of the instance of this object MUST be identical to the value of the instance with index 0. If the interface participates in the per-interface label space, then the instance of this object MUST represent the number of per-interface labels that are in use on this interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.2.1.2,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfacePerfInLabelLookupFailures,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This object counts the number of labeled packets that have been received on this interface and which were discarded because there was no matching cross- connect entry. This object MUST count on a per- interface basis regardless of which label space the interface participates in.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.2.1.3,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfacePerfOutLabelsInUse,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,This object counts the number of top-most labels in the outgoing label stacks that are in use at this point in time on this interface. This object MUST count on a per-interface basis regardless of which label space the interface participates in.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.2.1.4,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInterfacePerfOutFragmentedPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This object counts the number of outgoing MPLS packets that required fragmentation before transmission on this interface. This object MUST count on a per-interface basis regardless of which label space the interface participates in.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.3,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentIndexNext,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object contains the next available value to be used for mplsInSegmentIndex when creating entries in the mplsInSegmentTable. The special value of a string containing the single octet 0x00 indicates that no new entries can be created in this table. Agents not allowing managers to create entries in this table MUST set this object to this special value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains a description of the incoming MPLS segments (labels) to an LSR and their associated parameters. The index for this table is mplsInSegmentIndex. The index structure of this table is specifically designed to handle many different MPLS implementations that manage their labels both in a distributed and centralized manner. The table is also designed to handle existing MPLS labels as defined in RFC3031 as well as longer ones that may be necessary in the future. In cases where the label cannot fit into the mplsInSegmentLabel object, the mplsInSegmentLabelPtr will indicate this by being set to the first accessible column in the appropriate extension table's row. In this case an additional table MUST be provided and MUST be indexed by at least the indexes used by this table. In all other cases when the label is represented within the mplsInSegmentLabel object, the mplsInSegmentLabelPtr MUST be set to 0.0. Due to the fact that MPLS labels may not exceed 24 bits, the mplsInSegmentLabelPtr object is only a provision for future-proofing the MIB module. Thus, the definition of any extension tables is beyond the scope of this MIB module.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentEntry,,not-accessible,mplsInSegmentIndex,current,,An entry in this table represents one incoming segment as is represented in an LSR's LFIB. An entry can be created by a network administrator or an SNMP agent, or an MPLS signaling protocol. The creator of the entry is denoted by mplsInSegmentOwner. The value of mplsInSegmentRowStatus cannot be active(1) unless the ifTable entry corresponding to mplsInSegmentInterface exists. An entry in this table must match any incoming packets, and indicates an instance of mplsXCEntry based on which forwarding and/or switching actions are taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentIndex,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The index for this in-segment. The string containing the single octet 0x00 MUST not be used as an index.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.2,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentInterface,Integer32,read-create,,current,,This object represents the interface index for the incoming MPLS interface. A value of zero represents all interfaces participating in the per-platform label space. This may only be used in cases where the incoming interface and label are associated with the same mplsXCEntry. Specifically, given a label and any incoming interface pair from the per-platform label space, the outgoing label/interface mapping remains the same. If this is not the case, then individual entries MUST exist that can then be mapped to unique mplsXCEntries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.3,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentLabel,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,If the corresponding instance of mplsInSegmentLabelPtr is zeroDotZero then this object MUST contain the incoming label associated with this in-segment. If not this object SHOULD be zero and MUST be ignored.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.4,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentLabelPtr,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,If the label for this segment cannot be represented fully within the mplsInSegmentLabel object, this object MUST point to the first accessible column of a conceptual row in an external table containing the label. In this case, the mplsInSegmentTopLabel object SHOULD be set to 0 and ignored. This object MUST be set to zeroDotZero otherwise. DEFVAL { zeroDotZero }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.5,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentNPop,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The number of labels to pop from the incoming packet. Normally only the top label is popped from the packet and used for all switching decisions for that packet. This is indicated by setting this object to the default value of 1. If an LSR supports popping of more than one label, this object MUST be set to that number. This object cannot be modified if mplsInSegmentRowStatus is active(1). DEFVAL { 1 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.6,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentAddrFamily,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(0):ipV4(1):ipV6(2):nsap(3):hdlc(4):bbn1822(5):all802(6):e163(7):e164(8):f69(9):x121(10):ipx(11):appleTalk(12):decnetIV(13):banyanVines(14):e164withNsap(15):dns(16):distinguishedName(17):asNumber(18):xtpOverIpv4(19):xtpOverIpv6(20):xtpNativeModeXTP(21):fibreChannelWWPN(22):fibreChannelWWNN(23):gwid(24):afi(25):mplsTpSectionEndpointIdentifier(26):mplsTpLspEndpointIdentifier(27):mplsTpPseudowireEndpointIdentifier(28):eigrpCommonServiceFamily(16384):eigrpIpv4ServiceFamily(16385):eigrpIpv6ServiceFamily(16386):lispCanonicalAddressFormat(16387):bgpLs(16388):fortyeightBitMac(16389):sixtyfourBitMac(16390):oui(16391):mac24(16392):mac40(16393):ipv664(16394):rBridgePortID(16395):trillNickname(16396):reserved(65535),The IANA address family [IANAFamily] of packets received on this segment, which is used at an egress LSR to deliver them to the appropriate layer 3 entity. A value of other(0) indicates that the family type is either unknown or undefined; this SHOULD NOT be used at an egress LSR. This object cannot be modified if mplsInSegmentRowStatus is active(1). DEFVAL { other }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.7,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentXCIndex,OCTET,read-only,,current,,Index into mplsXCTable which identifies which cross- connect entry this segment is part of. The string containing the single octet 0x00 indicates that this entry is not referred to by any cross-connect entry. When a cross-connect entry is created which this in-segment is a part of, this object is automatically updated to reflect the value of mplsXCIndex of that cross-connect entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.8,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentOwner,INTEGER,read-only,,current,unknown(1):other(2):snmp(3):ldp(4):crldp(5):rsvpTe(6):policyAgent(7),Denotes the entity that created and is responsible for managing this segment.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.9,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentTrafficParamPtr,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This variable represents a pointer to the traffic parameter specification for this in-segment. This value may point at an entry in the mplsTunnelResourceTable in the MPLS-TE-STD-MIB (RFC3812) to indicate which traffic parameter settings for this segment if it represents an LSP used for a TE tunnel. This value may optionally point at an externally defined traffic parameter specification table. A value of zeroDotZero indicates best-effort treatment. By having the same value of this object, two or more segments can indicate resource sharing of such things as LSP queue space, etc. This object cannot be modified if mplsInSegmentRowStatus is active(1). For entries in this table that are preserved after a re-boot, the agent MUST ensure that their integrity be preserved, or this object should be set to 0.0 if it cannot. DEFVAL { zeroDotZero }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.10,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentRowStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),This variable is used to create, modify, and/or delete a row in this table. When a row in this table has a row in the active(1) state, no objects in this row can be modified except the mplsInSegmentRowStatus and mplsInSegmentStorageType.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.4.1.11,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentStorageType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3):permanent(4):readOnly(5),This variable indicates the storage type for this object. The agent MUST ensure that this object's value remains consistent with the associated mplsXCEntry. Conceptual rows having the value 'permanent' need not allow write-access to any columnar objects in the row. DEFVAL { volatile }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.5,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentPerfTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains statistical information for incoming MPLS segments to an LSR.

The counters in this entry should behave in a manner similar to that of the interface. mplsInSegmentPerfDiscontinuityTime indicates the time of the last discontinuity in all of these objects.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.5.1.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentPerfOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,This value represents the total number of octets received by this segment. It MUST be equal to the least significant 32 bits of mplsInSegmentPerfHCOctets if mplsInSegmentPerfHCOctets is supported according to the rules spelled out in RFC2863.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.5.1.2,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentPerfPackets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,Total number of packets received by this segment.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.5.1.4,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentPerfDiscards,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of labeled packets received on this in- segment, which were chosen to be discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being transmitted. One possible reason for discarding such a labeled packet could be to free up buffer space.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.5.1.5,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentPerfHCOctets,Counter64,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets received. This is the 64 bit version of mplsInSegmentPerfOctets, if mplsInSegmentPerfHCOctets is supported according to the rules spelled out in RFC2863.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.5.1.6,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsInSegmentPerfDiscontinuityTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which any one or more of this segment's Counter32 or Counter64 suffered a discontinuity. If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re- initialization of the local management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.6,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsOutSegmentIndexNext,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object contains the next available value to be used for mplsOutSegmentIndex when creating entries in the mplsOutSegmentTable. The special value of a string containing the single octet 0x00 indicates that no new entries can be created in this table. Agents not allowing managers to create entries in this table MUST set this object to this special value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.7,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsOutSegmentTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains a representation of the outgoing segments from an LSR.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.7.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsOutSegmentEntry,,not-accessible,mplsOutSegmentIndex,current,,An entry in this table represents one outgoing segment. An entry can be created by a network administrator, an SNMP agent, or an MPLS signaling protocol. The object mplsOutSegmentOwner indicates the creator of this entry. The value of mplsOutSegmentRowStatus cannot be active(1) unless the ifTable entry corresponding to mplsOutSegmentInterface exists. Note that the indexing of this table uses a single, arbitrary index (mplsOutSegmentIndex) to indicate which out-segment (i.e.: label) is being switched to from which in-segment (i.e: label) or in-segments. This is necessary because it is possible to have an equal-cost multi-path situation where two identical out-going labels are assigned to the same cross-connect (i.e.: they go to two different neighboring LSRs); thus, requiring two out-segments. In order to preserve the uniqueness of the references by the mplsXCEntry, an arbitrary integer must be used as the index for this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.7.1.1,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsOutSegmentIndex,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,This value contains a unique index for this row. While a value of a string containing the single octet 0x00 is not valid as an index for entries in this table, it can be supplied as a valid value to index the mplsXCTable to represent entries for which no out-segment has been configured or exists.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.7.1.2,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsOutSegmentInterface,Integer32,read-create,,current,,This value must contain the interface index of the outgoing interface. This object cannot be modified if mplsOutSegmentRowStatus is active(1). The mplsOutSegmentRowStatus cannot be set to active(1) until this object is set to a value corresponding to a valid ifEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.7.1.3,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsOutSegmentPushTopLabel,INTEGER,read-create,,current,true(1):false(2),This value indicates whether or not a top label should be pushed onto the outgoing packet's label stack. The value of this variable MUST be set to true(1) if the outgoing interface does not support pop-and-go (and no label stack remains). For example, on ATM interface, or if the segment represents a tunnel origination. Note that it is considered an error in the case that mplsOutSegmentPushTopLabel is set to false, but the cross-connect entry which refers to this out-segment has a non-zero mplsLabelStackIndex. The LSR MUST ensure that this situation does not happen. This object cannot be modified if mplsOutSegmentRowStatus is active(1). DEFVAL { true }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.7.1.4,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsOutSegmentTopLabel,Unsigned32,read-create,,current,,If mplsOutSegmentPushTopLabel is true then this represents the label that should be pushed onto the top of the outgoing packet's label stack. Otherwise this value SHOULD be set to 0 by the management station and MUST be ignored by the agent. This object cannot be modified if mplsOutSegmentRowStatus is active(1). DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.7.1.5,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsOutSegmentTopLabelPtr,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,If the label for this segment cannot be represented fully within the mplsOutSegmentLabel object, this object MUST point to the first accessible column of a conceptual row in an external table containing the label. In this case, the mplsOutSegmentTopLabel object SHOULD be set to 0 and ignored. This object MUST be set to zeroDotZero otherwise. DEFVAL { zeroDotZero }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.7.1.6,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsOutSegmentNextHopAddrType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,unknown(0):ipv4(1):ipv6(2):ipv4z(3):ipv6z(4):dns(16),Indicates the next hop Internet address type. Only values unknown(0), ipv4(1) or ipv6(2) have to be supported. A value of unknown(0) is allowed only when the outgoing interface is of type point-to-point. If any other unsupported values are attempted in a set operation, the agent MUST return an inconsistentValue error.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.2.1.7.1.7,MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB::mplsOutSegmentNextHopAddr,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The internet address of the next hop. The type of this address is determined by the value of the mplslOutSegmentNextHopAddrType object. This object cannot be modified if mplsOutSegmentRowStatus is active(1).

A value of the string containing the single octet 0x00 indicates that this entry is not referred to by any cross-connect entry. When a cross-connect entry is created which this out-segment is a part of, this object MUST be updated by the agent to reflect the value of mplsXCIndex of that cross-connect entry.

Negative values are not allowed, as they do not correspond to valid values of mplsTunnelIndex. Note that this object offers an unused value for an mplsTunnelIndex value at the ingress side of a tunnel. At other LSRs the value of mplsTunnelIndex SHOULD be taken from the value signaled by the MPLS signaling protocol. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.3.2.2,MPLS-TE-STD-MIB::mplsTunnelTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The mplsTunnelTable allows new MPLS tunnels to be created between an LSR and a remote endpoint, and existing tunnels to be reconfigured or removed. Note that only point-to-point tunnel segments are supported, although multipoint-to-point and point- to-multipoint connections are supported by an LSR acting as a cross-connect. Each MPLS tunnel can thus have one out-segment originating at this LSR and/or one in-segment terminating at this LSR.

A tunnel entry needs to be uniquely identified across a MPLS network. Indices mplsTunnelIndex and mplsTunnelInstance uniquely identify a tunnel on the LSR originating the tunnel. To uniquely identify a tunnel across an MPLS network requires index mplsTunnelIngressLSRId. The last index mplsTunnelEgressLSRId is useful in identifying all instances of a tunnel that terminate on the same egress LSR.

If the number of unassigned entries is exhausted, a retrieval operation will return a value of 0. This object may also return a value of 0 when the LSR is unable to accept conceptual row creation, for example, if the mplsTunnelHopTable is implemented as read-only. To obtain the value of mplsTunnelHopListIndex for a new entry in the mplsTunnelHopTable, the manager issues a management protocol retrieval operation to obtain the current value of mplsTunnelHopIndex. When the SET is performed to create a row in the mplsTunnelHopTable, the Command Responder (agent) must determine whether the value is indeed still unused; Two Network Management Applications may attempt to create a row (configuration entry) simultaneously and use the same value. If it is currently unused, the SET succeeds and the Command Responder (agent) changes the value of this object, according to an implementation-specific algorithm. If the value is in use, however, the SET fails. The Network Management Application must then re-read this variable to obtain a new usable value.

Thus at a transit LSR, this table contains the desired path of the tunnel from this LSR onwards. Each row in this table is indexed by mplsTunnelHopListIndex which corresponds to a group of hop lists or path options. Each row also has a secondary index mplsTunnelHopIndex, which indicates a group of hops (also known as a path option). Finally, the third index, mplsTunnelHopIndex indicates the specific hop information for a path option. In case we want to specify a particular interface on the originating LSR of an outgoing tunnel by which we want packets to exit the LSR, we specify this as the first hop for this tunnel in mplsTunnelHopTable.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166.3.2.7,MPLS-TE-STD-MIB::mplsTunnelARHopTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The mplsTunnelARHopTable is used to indicate the hops for an MPLS tunnel defined in mplsTunnelTable, as reported by the MPLS signalling protocol. Thus at a transit LSR, this table (if the table is supported and if the signaling protocol is recording actual route information) contains the actual route of the whole tunnel. If the signaling protocol is not recording the actual route, this table MAY report the information from the mplsTunnelHopTable or the mplsTunnelCHopTable. Each row in this table is indexed by mplsTunnelARHopListIndex. Each row also has a secondary index mplsTunnelARHopIndex, corresponding to the next hop that this row corresponds to. Please note that since the information necessary to build entries within this table is not provided by some MPLS signalling protocols, implementation of this table is optional. Furthermore, since the information in this table is actually provided by the MPLS signalling protocol after the path has been set-up, the entries in this table are provided only for observation, and hence, all variables in this table are accessible exclusively as read- only. Note also that the contents of this table may change while it is being read because of re-routing activities. A network administrator may verify that the actual route read is consistent by reference to the mplsTunnelLastPathChange object.

Thus at a transit LSR, this table (if the table is supported) MAY contain the path computed by the CSPF engine on (or on behalf of) this LSR. Each row in this table is indexed by mplsTunnelCHopListIndex. Each row also has a secondary index mplsTunnelCHopIndex, corresponding to the next hop that this row corresponds to. In case we want to specify a particular interface on the originating LSR of an outgoing tunnel by which we want packets to exit the LSR, we specify this as the first hop for this tunnel in mplsTunnelCHopTable.

This MIB module enables the use of any underlying packet switched network (PSN). MIB nodules that will support PW operations over specific PSN types are defined in separate memos. The indexes for this MIB module are also used to index the PSN-specific tables and the PW-specific tables. The PW Type dictates which PW-specific MIB module to use.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.246.0.1,PW-STD-MIB::pwDown,,,,,,This notification is generated when the pwOperStatus object for one or more contiguous entries in the pwTable are about to enter the down(2) or lowerLayerDown(6) state from any other state, except for transition from the notPresent(5) state. For the purpose of deciding when these notifications occur, the lowerLayerDown(6) state and the down(2) state are considered to be equivalent; i.e., there is no notification on transition from lowerLayerDown(6) into down(2), and there is a trap on transition from any other state except down(2) (and notPresent) into lowerLayerDown(6). The included values of pwOperStatus MUST each be equal to down(2) or lowerLayerDown(6). The two instances of pwOperStatus in this notification indicate the range of indexes that are affected. Note that all the indexes of the two ends of the range can be derived from the instance identifiers of these two objects. For cases where a contiguous range of cross-connects have transitioned into the down(2) and lowerLayerDown(6) states at roughly the same time, the device SHOULD issue a single notification for each range of contiguous indexes in an effort to minimize the emission of a large number of notifications. If a notification has to be issued for just a single cross-connect entry, then the instance identifier (and values) of the two pwOperStatus objects MUST be identical.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.246.0.2,PW-STD-MIB::pwUp,,,,,,This notification is generated when the pwOperStatus object for one or more contiguous entries in the pwTable are about to enter the up(1) state from some other state except the notPresent(5) state and given that the pwDown notification been issued for these entries. The included values of pwOperStatus MUST both be set equal to this new state (i.e., up(1)). The two instances of pwOperStatus in this notification indicate the range of indexes that are affected. Note that all the indexes of the two ends of the range can be derived from the instance identifiers of these two objects. For cases where a contiguous range of cross-connects have transitioned into the up(1) state at roughly the same time, the device SHOULD issue a single notification for each range of contiguous indexes in an effort to minimize the emission of a large number of notifications. If a notification has to be issued for just a single cross-connect entry, then the instance identifier (and values) of the two pwOperStatus objects MUST be identical.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.246.0.3,PW-STD-MIB::pwDeleted,,,,,,This notification is generated when the PW has been deleted, i.e., when the pwRowStatus has been set to destroy(6) or the PW has been deleted by a non-MIB application or due to an auto-discovery process. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.246.1,PW-STD-MIB::pwObjects,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.246.1.1,PW-STD-MIB::pwIndexNext,Unsigned32,read-only,,current,,This object contains an appropriate value to be used for pwIndex when creating entries in the pwTable. The value 0 indicates that no unassigned entries are available. To obtain the value of pwIndex for a new entry in the pwTable, the manager issues a management protocol retrieval operation. The agent will determine through its local policy when this index value will be made available for reuse.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.246.1.2,PW-STD-MIB::pwTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table specifies information for configuring and status monitoring that is common to all service types and PSN types.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.246.1.2.1,PW-STD-MIB::pwEntry,,not-accessible,pwIndex,current,,A row in this table represents a pseudowire (PW) virtual connection across a packet network. It is indexed by pwIndex, which uniquely identifies a singular connection. A row can be created by an operator command from a management plan of a PE, by signaling, or due to auto- discovery process. An operator's command can be issued via a non-SNMP application; in such case, a row will be created implicitly by the agent. The read-create objects in this table are divided into three categories: 1) Objects that MUST NOT be changed after row activation. These are objects that define basic properties of the PW (for example type, destination, etc.). 2) Objects that MAY be changed when the PW is defined as not active. A change of these objects involves re-signaling of the PW or it might be traffic affecting. PW not active is defined as one of the following conditions: a) The pwRowStatus is notInService(2). b) The pwRowStatus is notReady(3). c) The pwAdminStatus is down(2). If the operator needs to change one of the values for an active row, the operator can either set the pwRowStatus to notInService(2) or set pwAdminStatus to down(2). Signaling (or traffic) is initiated again upon setting the pwRowStatus to active(1) or setting the pwAdminStatus to up(1) or testing(3), respectively. 3) Objects that MAY be changed at any time. A PW MAY have an entry in the ifTable in addition to the entry in this table. In this case, a special ifType for PW will be set in the ifTable, and the ifIndex in the ifTable of the PW will be set in the pwIfIndex object in this table. By default, all the read-create objects MUST NOT be changed after row activation, unless specifically indicated in the individual object description. Manual entries in this table SHOULD be preserved after a reboot; the agent MUST ensure the integrity of those entries. If the set of entries of a specific row are found to be inconsistent after reboot, the PW pwOperStatus MUST be declared as notPresent(5).

'manual' is used in all cases where no maintenance protocol (PW signaling) is used to set up the PW, i.e., configuration of entries in the PW tables including PW labels, etc., is done by setting the MIB fields manually. 'pwIdFecSignaling' is used in case of signaling with the Pwid FEC element with LDP signaling. 'genFecSignaling' is used in case of LDP signaling with the generalized FEC. 'l2tpControlProtocol' indicates the use of the L2TP control protocol. 'other' is used for other types of signaling.

PWs with the same priority are treated with equal priority. PWs that have not yet completed setup will report 'dormant' in the pwOperStatus. This value is significant if there are competing resources among PWs and the implementation supports this feature. Equal priority handling with competing resources is implementation specific.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::etherStatsEntry,,not-accessible,etherStatsIndex,current,,A collection of statistics kept for a particular Ethernet interface. As an example, an instance of the etherStatsPkts object might be named etherStatsPkts.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::etherStatsIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of this object uniquely identifies this etherStats entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::etherStatsDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data that this etherStats entry is configured to analyze. This source can be any ethernet interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated etherStatsStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::etherStatsDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources. Note that this number is not necessarily the number of packets dropped; it is just the number of times this condition has been detected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::etherStatsOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets of data (including those in bad packets) received on the network (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets). This object can be used as a reasonable estimate of 10-Megabit ethernet utilization. If greater precision is desired, the etherStatsPkts and etherStatsOctets objects should be sampled before and after a common interval. The differences in the sampled values are Pkts and Octets, respectively, and the number of seconds in the interval is Interval. These values are used to calculate the Utilization as follows: Pkts * (9.6 + 6.4) + (Octets * .8) Utilization = ------------------------------------- Interval * 10,000 The result of this equation is the value Utilization which is the percent utilization of the ethernet segment on a scale of 0 to 100 percent.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::etherStatsPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets (including bad packets, broadcast packets, and multicast packets) received.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::etherStatsMulticastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of good packets received that were directed to a multicast address. Note that this number does not include packets directed to the broadcast address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::etherStatsCRCAlignErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that had a length (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets) of between 64 and 1518 octets, inclusive, but had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::etherStatsUndersizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were less than 64 octets long (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets) and were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::etherStatsOversizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets) and were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::etherStatsFragments,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were less than 64 octets in length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that it is entirely normal for etherStatsFragments to increment. This is because it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences due to collisions) and noise hits.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::etherStatsJabbers,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets), and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that this definition of jabber is different than the definition in IEEE-802.3 section 8.2.1.5 (10BASE5) and section 10.3.1.4 (10BASE2). These documents define jabber as the condition where any packet exceeds 20 ms. The allowed range to detect jabber is between 20 ms and 150 ms.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.1.1.1.13,RMON-MIB::etherStatsCollisions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the total number of collisions on this Ethernet segment. The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1,RMON-MIB::historyControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of history control entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::historyControlEntry,,not-accessible,historyControlIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a periodic sampling of statistics. As an example, an instance of the historyControlInterval object might be named historyControlInterval.2
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::historyControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the historyControl table. Each such entry defines a set of samples at a particular interval for an interface on the device.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::historyControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data for which historical data was collected and placed in a media-specific table on behalf of this historyControlEntry. This source can be any interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated historyControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::historyControlBucketsRequested,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The requested number of discrete time intervals over which data is to be saved in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set historyControlBucketsGranted as closely to this object as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. DEFVAL { 50 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::historyControlBucketsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of discrete sampling intervals over which data shall be saved in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. When the associated historyControlBucketsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated historyControlBucketsRequested object. There will be times when the actual number of buckets associated with this entry is less than the value of this object. In this case, at the end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will be added to the media-specific table. When the number of buckets reaches the value of this object and a new bucket is to be added to the media-specific table, the oldest bucket associated with this historyControlEntry shall be deleted by the agent so that the new bucket can be added. When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their number remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated media- specific entries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::historyControlInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled for each bucket in the part of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry. This interval can be set to any number of seconds between 1 and 3600 (1 hour). Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will take into account the possibility of overflow in any of the associated counters. It is important to consider the minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a particular media type and set the historyControlInterval object to a value less than this interval. This is typically most important for the 'octets' counter in any media-specific table. For example, on an Ethernet network, the etherHistoryOctets counter could overflow in about one hour at the Ethernet's maximum utilization. This object may not be modified if the associated historyControlStatus object is equal to valid(1). DEFVAL { 1800 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::historyControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

Each instance of the media-specific table associated with this historyControlEntry will be deleted by the agent if this historyControlEntry is not equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of Ethernet history entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryEntry,,not-accessible,etherHistoryIndex:etherHistorySampleIndex,current,,An historical sample of Ethernet statistics on a particular Ethernet interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::etherHistorySampleIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies the particular sample this entry represents among all samples associated with the same historyControlEntry. This index starts at 1 and increases by one as each new sample is taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryIntervalStart,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the start of the interval over which this sample was measured. If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require the probe to delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample which is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryDropEvents,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of events in which packets were dropped by the probe due to lack of resources during this sampling interval. Note that this number is not necessarily the number of packets dropped, it is just the number of times this condition has been detected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of octets of data (including those in bad packets) received on the network (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets).

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.8,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryMulticastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets received during this sampling interval that were directed to a multicast address. Note that this number does not include packets addressed to the broadcast address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryCRCAlignErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that had a length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) between 64 and 1518 octets, inclusive, but had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.10,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryUndersizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were less than 64 octets long (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) and were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.11,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryOversizePkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) but were otherwise well formed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.12,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryFragments,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of packets received during this sampling interval that were less than 64 octets in length (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets) had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that it is entirely normal for etherHistoryFragments to increment. This is because it counts both runts (which are normal occurrences due to collisions) and noise hits.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.13,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryJabbers,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets received during this sampling interval that were longer than 1518 octets (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets), and had either a bad Frame Check Sequence (FCS) with an integral number of octets (FCS Error) or a bad FCS with a non-integral number of octets (Alignment Error). Note that this definition of jabber is different than the definition in IEEE-802.3 section 8.2.1.5 (10BASE5) and section 10.3.1.4 (10BASE2). These documents define jabber as the condition where any packet exceeds 20 ms. The allowed range to detect jabber is between 20 ms and 150 ms.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.14,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryCollisions,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the total number of collisions on this Ethernet segment during this sampling interval. The value returned will depend on the location of the RMON probe. Section 8.2.1.3 (10BASE-5) and section 10.3.1.3 (10BASE-2) of IEEE standard 802.3 states that a station must detect a collision, in the receive mode, if three or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. A repeater port must detect a collision when two or more stations are transmitting simultaneously. Thus a probe placed on a repeater port could record more collisions than a probe connected to a station on the same segment would. Probe location plays a much smaller role when considering 10BASE-T. 14.2.1.4 (10BASE-T) of IEEE standard 802.3 defines a collision as the simultaneous presence of signals on the DO and RD circuits (transmitting and receiving at the same time). A 10BASE-T station can only detect collisions when it is transmitting. Thus probes placed on a station and a repeater, should report the same number of collisions. Note also that an RMON probe inside a repeater should ideally report collisions between the repeater and one or more other hosts (transmit collisions as defined by IEEE 802.3k) plus receiver collisions observed on any coax segments to which the repeater is connected.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.2.1.15,RMON-MIB::etherHistoryUtilization,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The best estimate of the mean physical layer network utilization on this interface during this sampling interval, in hundredths of a percent.

If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require the probe to delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample which is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.2.5.1.1,RMON2-MIB::historyControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3,RMON-MIB::alarm,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1,RMON-MIB::alarmTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of alarm entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1,RMON-MIB::alarmEntry,,not-accessible,alarmIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a periodic checking for alarm conditions. For example, an instance of the alarmValue object might be named alarmValue.8
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::alarmIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the alarm table. Each such entry defines a diagnostic sample at a particular interval for an object on the device.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::alarmInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled and compared with the rising and falling thresholds. When setting this variable, care should be taken in the case of deltaValue sampling - the interval should be set short enough that the sampled variable is very unlikely to increase or decrease by more than 2^31 - 1 during a single sampling interval. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::alarmVariable,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The object identifier of the particular variable to be sampled. Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of INTEGER (INTEGER, Integer32, Counter32, Counter64, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled. Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view. Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the read access that could be obtained through the alarm mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this object in those views that have read access to all objects on the probe. During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be returned. If at any time the variable name of an established alarmEntry is no longer available in the selected MIB view, the probe must change the status of this alarmEntry to invalid(4). This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::alarmSampleType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,absoluteValue(1):deltaValue(2),The method of sampling the selected variable and calculating the value to be compared against the thresholds. If the value of this object is absoluteValue(1), the value of the selected variable will be compared directly with the thresholds at the end of the sampling interval. If the value of this object is deltaValue(2), the value of the selected variable at the last sample will be subtracted from the current value, and the difference compared with the thresholds. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::alarmValue,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of the statistic during the last sampling period. For example, if the sample type is deltaValue, this value will be the difference between the samples at the beginning and end of the period. If the sample type is absoluteValue, this value will be the sampled value at the end of the period. This is the value that is compared with the rising and falling thresholds. The value during the current sampling period is not made available until the period is completed and will remain available until the next period completes.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::alarmStartupAlarm,INTEGER,read-create,,current,risingAlarm(1):fallingAlarm(2):risingOrFallingAlarm(3),The alarm that may be sent when this entry is first set to valid. If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to the risingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single rising alarm will be generated. If the first sample after this entry becomes valid is less than or equal to the fallingThreshold and alarmStartupAlarm is equal to fallingAlarm(2) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3), then a single falling alarm will be generated. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::alarmRisingThreshold,Integer32,read-create,,current,,A threshold for the sampled statistic. When the current sampled value is greater than or equal to this threshold, and the value at the last sampling interval was less than this threshold, a single event will be generated. A single event will also be generated if the first sample after this entry becomes valid is greater than or equal to this threshold and the associated alarmStartupAlarm is equal to risingAlarm(1) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3). After a rising event is generated, another such event will not be generated until the sampled value falls below this threshold and reaches the alarmFallingThreshold. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::alarmFallingThreshold,Integer32,read-create,,current,,A threshold for the sampled statistic. When the current sampled value is less than or equal to this threshold, and the value at the last sampling interval was greater than this threshold, a single event will be generated. A single event will also be generated if the first sample after this entry becomes valid is less than or equal to this threshold and the associated alarmStartupAlarm is equal to fallingAlarm(2) or risingOrFallingAlarm(3). After a falling event is generated, another such event will not be generated until the sampled value rises above this threshold and reaches the alarmRisingThreshold. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::alarmRisingEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The index of the eventEntry that is used when a rising threshold is crossed. The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.10,RMON-MIB::alarmFallingEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The index of the eventEntry that is used when a falling threshold is crossed. The eventEntry identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In particular, if this value is zero, no associated event will be generated, as zero is not a valid event index. This object may not be modified if the associated alarmStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.11,RMON-MIB::alarmOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.3.1.1.12,RMON-MIB::alarmStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this alarm entry.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostControlEntry,,not-accessible,hostControlIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up the discovery of hosts on a particular interface and the collection of statistics about these hosts. For example, an instance of the hostControlTableSize object might be named hostControlTableSize.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hostControl table. Each such entry defines a function that discovers hosts on a particular interface and places statistics about them in the hostTable and the hostTimeTable on behalf of this hostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object identifies the source of the data for this instance of the host function. This source can be any interface on this device. In order to identify a particular interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated hostControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostControlTableSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of hostEntries in the hostTable and the hostTimeTable associated with this hostControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::hostControlLastDeleteTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when the last entry was deleted from the portion of the hostTable associated with this hostControlEntry. If no deletions have occurred, this value shall be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::hostControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::hostControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,valid(1):createRequest(2):underCreation(3):invalid(4),The status of this hostControl entry. If this object is not equal to valid(1), all associated entries in the hostTable, hostTimeTable, and the hostTopNTable shall be deleted by the agent.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2,RMON-MIB::hostTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of host entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1,RMON-MIB::hostEntry,,not-accessible,hostIndex:hostAddress,current,,A collection of statistics for a particular host that has been discovered on an interface of this device. For example, an instance of the hostOutBroadcastPkts object might be named hostOutBroadcastPkts.1.6.8.0.32.27.3.176
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The physical address of this host.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostCreationOrder,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that defines the relative ordering of the creation time of hosts captured for a particular hostControlEntry. This index shall be between 1 and N, where N is the value of the associated hostControlTableSize. The ordering of the indexes is based on the order of each entry's insertion into the table, in which entries added earlier have a lower index value than entries added later. It is important to note that the order for a particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry is deleted from the table. Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTable. By observing this variable, the management station may detect the circumstances where a previous association between a value of hostCreationOrder and a hostEntry may no longer hold.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The set of collected host statistics of which this entry is a part. The set of hosts identified by a particular value of this index is associated with the hostControlEntry as identified by the same value of hostControlIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::hostInPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets transmitted to this address since it was added to the hostTable.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::hostOutOctets,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets transmitted by this address since it was added to the hostTable (excluding framing bits but including FCS octets), including those octets in bad packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.8,RMON-MIB::hostOutErrors,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of bad packets transmitted by this address since this host was added to the hostTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::hostOutBroadcastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets transmitted by this address that were directed to the broadcast address since this host was added to the hostTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.2.1.10,RMON-MIB::hostOutMulticastPkts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of good packets transmitted by this address that were directed to a multicast address since this host was added to the hostTable. Note that this number does not include packets directed to the broadcast address.

This collection includes the relative ordering of the creation time of this object. For example, an instance of the hostTimeOutBroadcastPkts object might be named hostTimeOutBroadcastPkts.1.687
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.3.1.1,RMON-MIB::hostTimeAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The physical address of this host.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.3.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostTimeCreationOrder,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the hostTime table among those entries associated with the same hostControlEntry. This index shall be between 1 and N, where N is the value of the associated hostControlTableSize. The ordering of the indexes is based on the order of each entry's insertion into the table, in which entries added earlier have a lower index value than entries added later. Thus the management station has the ability to learn of new entries added to this table without downloading the entire table. It is important to note that the index for a particular entry may change as an (earlier) entry is deleted from the table. Because this order may change, management stations should make use of the hostControlLastDeleteTime variable in the hostControlEntry associated with the relevant portion of the hostTimeTable. By observing this variable, the management station may detect the circumstances where a download of the table may have missed entries, and where a previous association between a value of hostTimeCreationOrder and a hostTimeEntry may no longer hold.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.3.1.3,RMON-MIB::hostTimeIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The set of collected host statistics of which this entry is a part. The set of hosts identified by a particular value of this index is associated with the hostControlEntry as identified by the same value of hostControlIndex.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.4.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::hostControlCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.5.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::hostTopNHostIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The host table for which a top N report will be prepared on behalf of this entry. The host table identified by a particular value of this index is associated with the same host table as identified by the same value of hostIndex. This object may not be modified if the associated hostTopNStatus object is equal to valid(1).

The new value is used as the requested duration of this report, which is loaded into the associated hostTopNDuration object. When this object is set to a non-zero value, any associated hostTopNEntries shall be made inaccessible by the monitor. While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. During this time, all associated hostTopNEntries shall remain inaccessible. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the hostTopNTable. Thus, the hostTopN table needs to be created only at the end of the collection interval. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.5.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::hostTopNDuration,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of seconds that this report has collected during the last sampling interval, or if this report is currently being collected, the number of seconds that this report is being collected during this sampling interval. When the associated hostTopNTimeRemaining object is set, this object shall be set by the probe to the same value and shall not be modified until the next time the hostTopNTimeRemaining is set. This value shall be zero if no reports have been requested for this hostTopNControlEntry. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.5.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::hostTopNRequestedSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of hosts requested for the top N table.

The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::filterIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the filter table. Each such entry defines one filter that is to be applied to every packet received on an interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataOffset,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The offset from the beginning of each packet where a match of packet data will be attempted. This offset is measured from the point in the physical layer packet after the framing bits, if any. For example, in an Ethernet frame, this point is at the beginning of the destination MAC address. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1). DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::filterPktData,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The data that is to be matched with the input packet. For each packet received, this filter and the accompanying filterPktDataMask and filterPktDataNotMask will be adjusted for the offset. The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that have the corresponding filterPktDataMask bit equal to one. The following three rules are then applied to every packet: (1) If the packet is too short and does not have data corresponding to part of the filterPktData, the packet will fail this data match. (2) For each relevant bit from the packet with the corresponding filterPktDataNotMask bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet is not equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktData, then the packet will fail this data match. (3) If for every relevant bit from the packet with the corresponding filterPktDataNotMask bit set to one, the bit from the packet is equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktData, then the packet will fail this data match. Any packets that have not failed any of the three matches above have passed this data match. In particular, a zero length filter will match any packet. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataMask,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The mask that is applied to the match process. After adjusting this mask for the offset, only those bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask are relevant for further processing by the match algorithm. The offset is applied to filterPktDataMask in the same way it is applied to the filter. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktData object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '1' bits until it reaches the length of the filterPktData object. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::filterPktDataNotMask,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The inversion mask that is applied to the match process. After adjusting this mask for the offset, those relevant bits in the received packet that correspond to bits cleared in this mask must all be equal to their corresponding bits in the filterPktData object for the packet to be accepted. In addition, at least one of those relevant bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask must be different to its corresponding bit in the filterPktData object. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktData object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the length of the filterPktData object. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatus,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The status that is to be matched with the input packet. The only bits relevant to this match algorithm are those that have the corresponding filterPktStatusMask bit equal to one. The following two rules are then applied to every packet: (1) For each relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet status is not equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. (2) If for every relevant bit from the packet status with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask bit set to one, the bit from the packet status is equal to the corresponding bit from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail this status match. Any packets that have not failed either of the two matches above have passed this status match. In particular, a zero length status filter will match any packet's status. The value of the packet status is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each error, E, that has been discovered in this packet, 2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum. The errors and the bits that represent them are dependent on the media type of the interface that this channel is receiving packets from. The errors defined for a packet captured off of an Ethernet interface are as follows: bit # Error 0 Packet is longer than 1518 octets 1 Packet is shorter than 64 octets 2 Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2). As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object will have other media-specific errors defined. For the purposes of this status matching algorithm, if the packet status is longer than this filterPktStatus object, this object is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the size of the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatusMask,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The mask that is applied to the status match process. Only those bits in the received packet that correspond to bits set in this mask are relevant for further processing by the status match algorithm. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktStatus object is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '1' bits until it reaches the size of the filterPktStatus. In addition, if a packet status is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the size of the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::filterPktStatusNotMask,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The inversion mask that is applied to the status match process. Those relevant bits in the received packet status that correspond to bits cleared in this mask must all be equal to their corresponding bits in the filterPktStatus object for the packet to be accepted. In addition, at least one of those relevant bits in the received packet status that correspond to bits set in this mask must be different to its corresponding bit in the filterPktStatus object for the packet to be accepted. For the purposes of the matching algorithm, if the associated filterPktStatus object or a packet status is longer than this mask, this mask is conceptually extended with '0' bits until it reaches the longer of the lengths of the filterPktStatus object and the packet status. This object may not be modified if the associated filterStatus object is equal to valid(1).

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1,RMON-MIB::channelEntry,,not-accessible,channelIndex,current,,A set of parameters for a packet channel applied on a particular interface. As an example, an instance of the channelMatches object might be named channelMatches.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.1,RMON-MIB::channelIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the channel table. Each such entry defines one channel, a logical data and event stream. It is suggested that before creating a channel, an application should scan all instances of the filterChannelIndex object to make sure that there are no pre-existing filters that would be inadvertently be linked to the channel.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.2,RMON-MIB::channelIfIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object uniquely identifies the interface on this remote network monitoring device to which the associated filters are applied to allow data into this channel. The interface identified by a particular value of this object is the same interface as identified by the same value of the ifIndex object, defined in RFC 2233 [17]. The filters in this group are applied to all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. An agent may or may not be able to tell if fundamental changes to the media of the interface have occurred and necessitate an invalidation of this entry. For example, a hot-pluggable ethernet card could be pulled out and replaced by a token-ring card. In such a case, if the agent has such knowledge of the change, it is recommended that it invalidate this entry. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::channelAcceptType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,acceptMatched(1):acceptFailed(2),This object controls the action of the filters associated with this channel. If this object is equal to acceptMatched(1), packets will be accepted to this channel if they are accepted by both the packet data and packet status matches of an associated filter. If this object is equal to acceptFailed(2), packets will be accepted to this channel only if they fail either the packet data match or the packet status match of each of the associated filters. In particular, a channel with no associated filters will match no packets if set to acceptMatched(1) case and will match all packets in the acceptFailed(2) case. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::channelDataControl,INTEGER,read-create,,current,on(1):off(2),This object controls the flow of data through this channel. If this object is on(1), data, status and events flow through this channel. If this object is off(2), data, status and events will not flow through this channel. DEFVAL { off }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::channelTurnOnEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to turn the associated channelDataControl from off to on when the event is generated. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelTurnOnEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.6,RMON-MIB::channelTurnOffEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to turn the associated channelDataControl from on to off when the event is generated. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelTurnOffEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::channelEventIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The value of this object identifies the event that is configured to be generated when the associated channelDataControl is on and a packet is matched. The event identified by a particular value of this object is the same event as identified by the same value of the eventIndex object. If there is no corresponding entry in the eventTable, then no association exists. In fact, if no event is intended for this channel, channelEventIndex must be set to zero, a non-existent event index. This object may not be modified if the associated channelStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.8,RMON-MIB::channelEventStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,eventReady(1):eventFired(2):eventAlwaysReady(3),The event status of this channel. If this channel is configured to generate events when packets are matched, a means of controlling the flow of those events is often needed. When this object is equal to eventReady(1), a single event may be generated, after which this object will be set by the probe to eventFired(2). While in the eventFired(2) state, no events will be generated until the object is modified to eventReady(1) (or eventAlwaysReady(3)). The management station can thus easily respond to a notification of an event by re-enabling this object. If the management station wishes to disable this flow control and allow events to be generated at will, this object may be set to eventAlwaysReady(3). Disabling the flow control is discouraged as it can result in high network traffic or other performance problems. DEFVAL { eventReady }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.2.1.9,RMON-MIB::channelMatches,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times this channel has matched a packet. Note that this object is updated even when channelDataControl is set to off.

This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.7.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::channelCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.

As an example, an instance of the bufferControlCaptureSliceSize object might be named bufferControlCaptureSliceSize.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.1,RMON-MIB::bufferControlIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the bufferControl table. The value of this index shall never be zero. Each such entry defines one set of packets that is captured and controlled by one or more filters.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.2,RMON-MIB::bufferControlChannelIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,An index that identifies the channel that is the source of packets for this bufferControl table. The channel identified by a particular value of this index is the same as identified by the same value of the channelIndex object. This object may not be modified if the associated bufferControlStatus object is equal to valid(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.3,RMON-MIB::bufferControlFullStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,spaceAvailable(1):full(2),This object shows whether the buffer has room to accept new packets or if it is full. If the status is spaceAvailable(1), the buffer is accepting new packets normally. If the status is full(2) and the associated bufferControlFullAction object is wrapWhenFull, the buffer is accepting new packets by deleting enough of the oldest packets to make room for new ones as they arrive. Otherwise, if the status is full(2) and the bufferControlFullAction object is lockWhenFull, then the buffer has stopped collecting packets. When this object is set to full(2) the probe must not later set it to spaceAvailable(1) except in the case of a significant gain in resources such as an increase of bufferControlOctetsGranted. In particular, the wrap-mode action of deleting old packets to make room for newly arrived packets must not affect the value of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.4,RMON-MIB::bufferControlFullAction,INTEGER,read-create,,current,lockWhenFull(1):wrapWhenFull(2),Controls the action of the buffer when it reaches the full status. When in the lockWhenFull(1) state and a packet is added to the buffer that fills the buffer, the bufferControlFullStatus will be set to full(2) and this buffer will stop capturing packets.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.5,RMON-MIB::bufferControlCaptureSliceSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of octets of each packet that will be saved in this capture buffer. For example, if a 1500 octet packet is received by the probe and this object is set to 500, then only 500 octets of the packet will be stored in the associated capture buffer. If this variable is set to 0, the capture buffer will save as many octets as is possible. This object may not be modified if the associated bufferControlStatus object is equal to valid(1). DEFVAL { 100 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.6,RMON-MIB::bufferControlDownloadSliceSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of octets of each packet in this capture buffer that will be returned in an SNMP retrieval of that packet. For example, if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the associated capture buffer, the associated bufferControlDownloadOffset is 0, and this object is set to 100, then the captureBufferPacket object that contains the packet will contain only the first 100 octets of the packet. A prudent manager will take into account possible interoperability or fragmentation problems that may occur if the download slice size is set too large. In particular, conformant SNMP implementations are not required to accept messages whose length exceeds 484 octets, although they are encouraged to support larger datagrams whenever feasible. DEFVAL { 100 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.7,RMON-MIB::bufferControlDownloadOffset,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The offset of the first octet of each packet in this capture buffer that will be returned in an SNMP retrieval of that packet. For example, if 500 octets of a packet have been stored in the associated capture buffer and this object is set to 100, then the captureBufferPacket object that contains the packet will contain bytes starting 100 octets into the packet. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.8,RMON-MIB::bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The requested maximum number of octets to be saved in this captureBuffer, including any implementation-specific overhead. If this variable is set to -1, the capture buffer will save as many octets as is possible. When this object is created or modified, the probe should set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted as closely to this object as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. However, if the object has the special value of -1, the probe must set bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted to -1. DEFVAL { -1 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.1.1.9,RMON-MIB::bufferControlMaxOctetsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of octets that can be saved in this captureBuffer, including overhead. If this variable is -1, the capture buffer will save as many octets as possible. When the bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as is possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. However, if the request object has the special value of -1, the probe must set this object to -1. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated bufferControlMaxOctetsRequested object. When this maximum number of octets is reached and a new packet is to be added to this capture buffer and the corresponding bufferControlFullAction is set to wrapWhenFull(2), enough of the oldest packets associated with this capture buffer shall be deleted by the agent so that the new packet can be added. If the corresponding bufferControlFullAction is set to lockWhenFull(1), the new packet shall be discarded. In either case, the probe must set bufferControlFullStatus to full(2). When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the captureBufferTable associated with this bufferControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these captureBufferEntries shall be deleted by the agent so that the number of octets used remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated captureBufferEntries may be allowed to grow.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.3,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketID,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An index that describes the order of packets that are received on a particular interface. The packetID of a packet captured on an interface is defined to be greater than the packetID's of all packets captured previously on the same interface. As the captureBufferPacketID object has a maximum positive value of 2^31 - 1, any captureBufferPacketID object shall have the value of the associated packet's packetID mod 2^31.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.4,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketData,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The data inside the packet, starting at the beginning of the packet plus any offset specified in the associated bufferControlDownloadOffset, including any link level headers. The length of the data in this object is the minimum of the length of the captured packet minus the offset, the length of the associated bufferControlCaptureSliceSize minus the offset, and the associated bufferControlDownloadSliceSize. If this minimum is less than zero, this object shall have a length of zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.5,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketLength,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The actual length (off the wire) of the packet stored in this entry, including FCS octets.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.8.2.1.7,RMON-MIB::captureBufferPacketStatus,Integer32,read-only,,current,,A value which indicates the error status of this packet. The value of this object is defined in the same way as filterPktStatus. The value is a sum. This sum initially takes the value zero. Then, for each error, E, that has been discovered in this packet, 2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum. The errors defined for a packet captured off of an Ethernet interface are as follows: bit # Error 0 Packet is longer than 1518 octets 1 Packet is shorter than 64 octets 2 Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment error 3 First packet in this capture buffer after it was detected that some packets were not processed correctly. 4 Packet's order in buffer is only approximate (May only be set for packets sent from the probe) For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2). As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this object will have other media-specific errors defined.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.10.7.1.2,RMON2-MIB::ringStationControlCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,deprecated,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.10.8,RMON2-MIB::sourceRoutingStats2Table,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,Contains the RMON-2 augmentations to RMON-1. This table has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.10.8.1,RMON2-MIB::sourceRoutingStats2Entry,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,Contains the RMON-2 augmentations to RMON-1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.10.8.1.1,RMON2-MIB::sourceRoutingStatsDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,deprecated,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11,RMON2-MIB::protocolDir,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time the protocol directory was last modified, either through insertions or deletions, or through modifications of the protocolDirAddressMapConfig, protocolDirHostConfig, or protocolDirMatrixConfig.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table lists the protocols that this agent has the capability to decode and count. There is one entry in this table for each such protocol. These protocols represent different network-layer, transport-layer, and higher-layer protocols. The agent should boot up with this table preconfigured with those protocols that it knows about and wishes to monitor. Implementations are strongly encouraged to support protocols higher than the network layer (at least for the protocol distribution group), even for implementations that don't support the application-layer groups.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDirID:protocolDirParameters,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDirTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDirLocalIndex.8.0.0.0.1.0.0.8.0.2.0.0, which is the encoding of a length of 8, followed by 8 subids encoding the protocolDirID of 1.2048, followed by a length of 2 and the 2 subids encoding zero-valued parameters. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirID,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A unique identifier for a particular protocol. Standard identifiers will be defined in such a manner that they can often be used as specifications for new protocols - i.e., a tree-structured assignment mechanism that matches the protocol encapsulation 'tree' and that has algorithmic assignment mechanisms for certain subtrees. See RFC 2074 for more details. Despite the algorithmic mechanism, the probe will only place entries in here for those protocols it chooses to collect. In other words, it need not populate this table with all possible ethernet protocol types, nor need it create them on the fly when it sees them. Whether it does these things is a matter of product definition (cost/benefit, usability) and is up to the designer of the product. If an entry is written to this table with a protocolDirID that the agent doesn't understand, either directly or algorithmically, the SET request will be rejected with an inconsistentName or badValue (for SNMPv1) error.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirParameters,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,A set of parameters for the associated protocolDirID. See the associated RMON2 Protocol Identifiers document for a description of the possible parameters. There will be one octet in this string for each sub-identifier in the protocolDirID, and the parameters will appear here in the same order as the associated sub-identifiers appear in the protocolDirID. Every node in the protocolDirID tree has a different, optional set of parameters defined (that is, the definition of parameters for a node is optional). The proper parameter value for each node is included in this string. Note that the inclusion of a parameter value in this string for each node is not optional. What is optional is that a node may have no parameters defined, in which case the parameter field for that node will be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The locally arbitrary but unique identifier associated with this protocolDir entry. The value for each supported protocol must remain constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's network management system to the next re-initialization, except that if a protocol is deleted and re-created, it must be re-created with a new value that has not been used since the last re-initialization. The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP entity. A protocolDirLocalIndex must not be re-used until the next agent restart in the event that the protocol directory entry is deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.4,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirDescr,OCTET,read-create,,current,,A textual description of the protocol encapsulation. A probe may choose to describe only a subset of the entire encapsulation (e.g., only the highest layer). This object is intended for human consumption only. This object may not be modified if the associated protocolDirStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.5,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirType,BITS,read-only,,current,extensible(0):addressRecognitionCapable(1),This object describes 2 attributes of this protocol directory entry. The presence or absence of the 'extensible' bit describes whether this protocol directory entry can be extended by the user by creating protocol directory entries that are children of this protocol. An example of an entry that will often allow extensibility is 'ip.udp'. The probe may automatically populate some children of this node, such as 'ip.udp.snmp' and 'ip.udp.dns'. A probe administrator or user may also populate additional children via remote SNMP requests that create entries in this table. When a child node is added for a protocol for which the probe has no built-in support extending a parent node (for which the probe does have built-in support), that child node is not extendable. This is termed 'limited extensibility'. When a child node is added through this extensibility mechanism, the values of protocolDirLocalIndex and protocolDirType shall be assigned by the agent. The other objects in the entry will be assigned by the manager who is creating the new entry. This object also describes whether this agent can recognize addresses for this protocol, should it be a network-level protocol. That is, while a probe may be able to recognize packets of a particular network-layer protocol and count them, it takes additional logic to be able to recognize the addresses in this protocol and to populate network-layer or application-layer tables with the addresses in this protocol. If this bit is set, the agent will recognize network-layer addresses for this protocol and populate the network- and application-layer host and matrix tables with these protocols. Note that when an entry is created, the agent will supply values for the bits that match the capabilities of the agent with respect to this protocol. Note that since row creations usually exercise the limited extensibility feature, these bits will usually be set to zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.6,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirAddressMapConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for address mapping for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to perform address mapping for the protocol or if this protocol is not a network-layer protocol. When an entry is created in this table by a management operation as part of the limited extensibility feature, the probe must set this value to notSupported(1), because limited extensibility of the protocolDirTable does not extend to interpreting addresses of the extended protocols. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not perform address mapping for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports address mapping for this protocol and is configured to perform address mapping for this protocol for all addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports address mapping for this protocol but is configured to not perform address mapping for this protocol for any addressMappingControlEntries and all interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the addressMappingTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.7,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirHostConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for the network-layer and application-layer host tables for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the nlHostTable for this protocol or if the alHostTable is implemented but doesn't have the capability to track this protocol. Note that if the alHostTable is implemented, the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both the nlHostTable and the alHostTable. If the associated protocolDirType object has the addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network- layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and thus the probe will populate the nlHostTable and alHostTable with addresses it discovers for this protocol. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not track the nlHostTable or alHostTable for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this protocol and is configured to track both tables for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports tracking of the nlHostTable and alHostTable for this protocol but is configured to not track these tables for any control entries or interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the nlHostTable and alHostTable. Note that since each alHostEntry references 2 protocol directory entries, one for the network address and one for the type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3) for both protocols.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.8,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirMatrixConfig,INTEGER,read-create,,current,notSupported(1):supportedOff(2):supportedOn(3),This object describes and configures the probe's support for the network-layer and application-layer matrix tables for this protocol. When the probe creates entries in this table for all protocols that it understands, it will set the entry to notSupported(1) if it doesn't have the capability to track the nlMatrixTables for this protocol or if the alMatrixTables are implemented but don't have the capability to track this protocol. Note that if the alMatrix tables are implemented, the probe may only support a protocol if it is supported in both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the alMatrixTables. If the associated protocolDirType object has the addressRecognitionCapable bit set, then this is a network- layer protocol for which the probe recognizes addresses, and thus the probe will populate both of the nlMatrixTables and both of the alMatrixTables with addresses it discovers for this protocol. If the value of this object is notSupported(1), the probe will not track either of the nlMatrixTables or the alMatrixTables for this protocol and shall not allow this object to be changed to any other value. If the value of this object is supportedOn(3), the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol and is configured to track these tables for this protocol for all control entries and all interfaces. If the value of this object is supportedOff(2), the probe supports tracking of both of the nlMatrixTables and (if implemented) both of the alMatrixTables for this protocol but is configured to not track these tables for this protocol for any control entries or interfaces. Whenever this value changes from supportedOn(3) to supportedOff(2), the probe shall delete all related entries in the nlMatrixTables and the alMatrixTables. Note that since each alMatrixEntry references 2 protocol directory entries, one for the network address and one for the type of the highest protocol recognized, an entry will only be created in that table if this value is supportedOn(3) for both protocols.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.9,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.11.2.1.10,RMON2-MIB::protocolDirStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this protocol directory entry. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the nlHostTable, nlMatrixSDTable, nlMatrixDSTable, alHostTable, alMatrixSDTable, and alMatrixDSTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12,RMON2-MIB::protocolDist,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,Controls the setup of protocol type distribution statistics tables. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of protocol statistics is available. Rationale: This table controls collection of very basic statistics for any or all of the protocols detected on a given interface. An NMS can use this table to quickly determine bandwidth allocation utilized by different protocols. A media-specific statistics collection could also be configured (e.g., etherStats, trPStats) to easily obtain total frame, octet, and droppedEvents for the same interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDistControlIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDistControlTable. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDistControlDroppedFrames.7
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,A unique index for this protocolDistControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlDataSource,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The source of data for the this protocol distribution. The statistics in this group reflect all packets on the local network segment attached to the identified interface. This object may not be modified if the associated protocolDistControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.3,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlCreateTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this control entry was last activated. This can be used by the management station to ensure that the table has not been deleted and recreated between polls.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.1.1.6,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this row. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the protocolDistStatsTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,An entry is made in this table for every protocol in the protocolDirTable that has been seen in at least one packet. Counters are updated in this table for every protocol type that is encountered when parsing a packet, but no counters are updated for packets with MAC-layer errors. Note that if a protocolDirEntry is deleted, all associated entries in this table are removed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsEntry,,not-accessible,protocolDistControlIndex:protocolDirLocalIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the protocolDistStatsTable. The index is composed of the protocolDistControlIndex of the associated protocolDistControlEntry, followed by the protocolDirLocalIndex of the associated protocol that this entry represents. In other words, the index identifies the protocol distribution an entry is a part of and the particular protocol that it represents. An example of the indexing of this entry is protocolDistStatsPkts.1.18
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsPkts,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets of this protocol type received without errors. Note that this is the number of link-layer packets, so if a single network-layer packet is fragmented into several link-layer frames, this counter is incremented several times.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.12.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::protocolDistStatsOctets,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets in packets of this protocol type received since it was added to the protocolDistStatsTable (excluding framing bits, but including FCS octets), except for those octets in packets that contained errors. Note that this doesn't count just those octets in the particular protocol frames but includes the entire packet that contained the protocol.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13,RMON2-MIB::addressMap,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an address mapping entry has been inserted into the addressMapTable. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting addressMapDeletes from addressMapInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapDeletes,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an address mapping entry has been deleted from the addressMapTable (for any reason). If an entry is deleted, then inserted, and then deleted, this counter will be incremented by 2. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting addressMapDeletes from addressMapInserts.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapMaxDesiredEntries,Integer32,read-write,,current,,The maximum number of entries that are desired in the addressMapTable. The probe will not create more than this number of entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table to control the collection of mappings from network layer address to physical address to interface. Note that this is not like the typical RMON controlTable and dataTable in which each entry creates its own data table. Each entry in this table enables the discovery of addresses on a new interface and the placement of address mappings into the central addressMapTable. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of address mappings is available.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlDroppedFrames,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The total number of frames that were received by the probe and therefore not accounted for in the *StatsDropEvents, but that the probe chose not to count for this entry for whatever reason. Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.4.1.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapControlStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of this addressMap control entry. An entry may not exist in the active state unless all objects in the entry have an appropriate value. If this object is not equal to active(1), all associated entries in the addressMapTable shall be deleted.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5,RMON2-MIB::addressMapTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of mappings from network layer address to physical address to interface. The probe will add entries to this table based on the source MAC and network addresses seen in packets without MAC-level errors. The probe will populate this table for all protocols in the protocol directory table whose value of protocolDirAddressMapConfig is equal to supportedOn(3), and will delete any entries whose protocolDirEntry is deleted or has a protocolDirAddressMapConfig value of supportedOff(2).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapEntry,,not-accessible,addressMapTimeMark:protocolDirLocalIndex:addressMapNetworkAddress:addressMapSource,current,,A conceptual row in the addressMapTable. The protocolDirLocalIndex in the index identifies the network layer protocol of the addressMapNetworkAddress. An example of the indexing of this entry is addressMapSource.783495.18.4.128.2.6.6.11.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol. Implementations should take care to avoid such combinations.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.1,RMON2-MIB::addressMapTimeMark,TimeTicks,not-accessible,,current,,A TimeFilter for this entry. See the TimeFilter textual convention to see how this works.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.2,RMON2-MIB::addressMapNetworkAddress,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The network address for this relation. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the protocolDirLocalIndex component of the index. For example, if the protocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of ip, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.3,RMON2-MIB::addressMapSource,OBJECT,not-accessible,,current,,The interface or port on which the associated network address was most recently seen. If this address mapping was discovered on an interface, this object shall identify the instance of the ifIndex object, defined in [RFC2863], for the desired interface. For example, if an entry were to receive data from interface #1, this object would be set to ifIndex.1. If this address mapping was discovered on a port, this object shall identify the instance of the rptrGroupPortIndex object, defined in [RFC2108], for the desired port. For example, if an entry were to receive data from group #1, port #1, this object would be set to rptrGroupPortIndex.1.1. Note that while the dataSource associated with this entry may only point to index objects, this object may at times point to repeater port objects. This situation occurs when the dataSource points to an interface that is a locally attached repeater and the agent has additional information about the source port of traffic seen on that repeater.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.13.5.1.4,RMON2-MIB::addressMapPhysicalAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The last source physical address on which the associated network address was seen. If the protocol of the associated network address was encapsulated inside of a network-level or higher protocol, this will be the address of the next-lower protocol with the addressRecognitionCapable bit enabled and will be formatted as specified for that protocol.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of higher-layer (i.e., non-MAC) host table control entries. These entries will enable the collection of the network- and application-level host tables indexed by network addresses. Both the network- and application-level host tables are controlled by this table so that they will both be created and deleted at the same time, further increasing the ease with which they can be implemented as a single datastore. (Note that if an implementation stores application-layer host records in memory, it can derive network-layer host records from them.) Entries in the nlHostTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Additionally, if this probe implements the alHostTable, entries in the alHostTable will be created on behalf of each entry in this table. Implementations are encouraged to add an entry per monitored interface upon initialization so that a default collection of host statistics is available.

Most often, this event occurs when the probe is out of some resources and decides to shed load from this collection. This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the nlHostTable is inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0. Note that, unlike the dropEvents counter, this number is the exact number of frames dropped.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.14.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::hlHostControlNlInserts,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of times an nlHost entry has been inserted into the nlHost table. If an entry is inserted, then deleted, and then inserted, this counter will be incremented by 2. To allow for efficient implementation strategies, agents may delay updating this object for short periods of time. For example, an implementation strategy may allow internal data structures to differ from those visible via SNMP for short periods of time. This counter may reflect the internal data structures for those short periods of time. Note that the table size can be determined by subtracting hlHostControlNlDeletes from hlHostControlNlInserts.

The probe will not create more than this number of associated entries in the table but may choose to create fewer entries in this table for any reason, including the lack of resources. If this object is set to a value less than the current number of entries, enough entries are chosen in an implementation-dependent manner and deleted so that the number of entries in the table equals the value of this object. If this value is set to -1, the probe may create any number of entries in this table. If the associated hlHostControlStatus object is equal to 'active', this object may not be modified. This object may be used to control how resources are allocated on the probe for the various RMON functions.

This count does not include packets that were not counted because they had MAC-layer errors. Note that if the alHostTable is not implemented or is inactive because no protocols are enabled in the protocol directory, this value should be 0.

This table is indexed first by the destination address and then by the source address to make it convenient to collect all conversations to a particular address. The probe will populate this table for all network layer protocols in the protocol directory table whose value of protocolDirMatrixConfig is equal to supportedOn(3), and will delete any entries whose protocolDirEntry is deleted or has a protocolDirMatrixConfig value of supportedOff(2). The probe will add to this table all pairs of addresses seen in all packets with no MAC errors and will increment octet and packet counts in the table for all packets with no MAC errors. Further, this table will only contain entries that have a corresponding entry in the nlMatrixSDTable with the same source address and destination address.

An example of the indexing of this table is nlMatrixDSPkts.1.783495.18.4.128.2.6.7.4.128.2.6.6. Note that some combinations of index values may result in an index that exceeds 128 sub-identifiers in length, which exceeds the maximum for the SNMP protocol.

This object may not be modified if the associated nlMatrixTopNControlStatus object is equal to active(1). If this value is less than or equal to 2, when the report is prepared, entries are created in the nlMatrixTopNTable associated with this object. If this value is greater than or equal to 3, when the report is prepared, entries are created in the nlMatrixTopNHighCapacityTable associated with this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The number of seconds left in the report currently being collected. When this object is modified by the management station, a new collection is started, possibly aborting a currently running report. The new value is used as the requested duration of this report and is immediately loaded into the associated nlMatrixTopNControlDuration object. When the report finishes, the probe will automatically start another collection with the same initial value of nlMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining. Thus, the management station may simply read the resulting reports repeatedly, checking the startTime and duration each time to ensure that a report was not missed or that the report parameters were not changed. While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the nlMatrixTopNTable, overwriting any report that may be there. When this object is modified by the management station, any associated entries in the nlMatrixTopNTable shall be deleted. (Note that this is a different algorithm than the one used in the hostTopNTable). DEFVAL { 1800 }

DEFVAL { 150 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.15.4.1.8,RMON2-MIB::nlMatrixTopNControlGrantedSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of matrix entries in this report. When the associated nlMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a side-effect of a set to the associated nlMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNPkts, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of nlMatrixTopNPktRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNOctets, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of nlMatrixTopNOctetRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. It is an implementation-specific matter how entries with the same value of nlMatrixTopNPktRate or nlMatrixTopNOctetRate are sorted. It is also an implementation-specific matter as to whether zero-valued entries are available.

In other words, this is the time that the associated nlMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining object was modified to start the requested report or the time the report was last automatically (re)started. This object may be used by the management station to determine whether a report was missed.

This index is between 1 and N, where N is the number of entries in this report. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNPkts, increasing values of nlMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of nlMatrixTopNPktRate until index N is assigned or there are no more nlMatrixTopNEntries. If the value of nlMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to nlMatrixTopNOctets, increasing values of nlMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of nlMatrixTopNOctetRate until index N is assigned or there are no more nlMatrixTopNEntries.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlMatrixIndex,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The alMatrix[SD/DS] table for which a topN report will be prepared on behalf of this entry. The alMatrix[SD/DS] table is identified by the value of the hlMatrixControlIndex for that table - that value is used here to identify the particular table. This object may not be modified if the associated alMatrixTopNControlStatus object is equal to active(1).

The values alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts, alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets, alMatrixTopNTerminalsHighCapacityPkts, and alMatrixTopNTerminalsHighCapacityOctets cause collection only from protocols that have no child protocols that are counted. The values alMatrixTopNAllPkts, alMatrixTopNAllOctets, alMatrixTopNAllHighCapacityPkts, and alMatrixTopNAllHighCapacityOctets cause collection from all alMatrix entries. This object may not be modified if the associated alMatrixTopNControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.4,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The number of seconds left in the report currently being collected. When this object is modified by the management station, a new collection is started, possibly aborting a currently running report. The new value is used as the requested duration of this report and is immediately loaded into the associated alMatrixTopNControlDuration object. When the report finishes, the probe will automatically start another collection with the same initial value of alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining. Thus, the management station may simply read the resulting reports repeatedly, checking the startTime and duration each time to ensure that a report was not missed or that the report parameters were not changed. While the value of this object is non-zero, it decrements by one per second until it reaches zero. At the time that this object decrements to zero, the report is made accessible in the alMatrixTopNTable, overwriting any report that may be there. When this object is modified by the management station, any associated entries in the alMatrixTopNTable shall be deleted. (Note that this is a different algorithm than the one used in the hostTopNTable). DEFVAL { 1800 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.5,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlGeneratedReports,Counter32,read-only,,current,,The number of reports that have been generated by this entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.6,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlDuration,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of seconds that this report has collected during the last sampling interval. When the associated alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining object is set, this object shall be set by the probe to the same value and shall not be modified until the next time the alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining is set. This value shall be zero if no reports have been requested for this alMatrixTopNControlEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.7,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The maximum number of matrix entries requested for this report.

DEFVAL { 150 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.8,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlGrantedSize,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The maximum number of matrix entries in this report. When the associated alMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a side-effect of a set to the associated alMatrixTopNControlRequestedSize object. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of alMatrixTopNPktRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, when the next topN report is generated, matrix entries with the highest value of alMatrixTopNOctetRate shall be placed in this table in decreasing order of this rate until there is no more room or until there are no more matrix entries. It is an implementation-specific matter how entries with the same value of alMatrixTopNPktRate or alMatrixTopNOctetRate are sorted. It is also an implementation-specific matter as to whether zero-valued entries are available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.9,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlStartTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime when this topN report was last started. In other words, this is the time that the associated alMatrixTopNControlTimeRemaining object was modified to start the requested report or the time the report was last automatically (re)started. This object may be used by the management station to determine whether a report was missed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.3.1.10,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNEntry,,not-accessible,alMatrixTopNControlIndex:alMatrixTopNIndex,current,,A conceptual row in the alMatrixTopNTable. The alMatrixTopNControlIndex value in the index identifies the alMatrixTopNControlEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. An example of the indexing of this table is alMatrixTopNPktRate.3.10
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.1,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the alMatrixTopNTable among those in the same report. This index is between 1 and N, where N is the number of entries in this report. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, increasing values of alMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of alMatrixTopNPktRate until index N is assigned or there are no more alMatrixTopNEntries. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, increasing values of alMatrixTopNIndex shall be assigned to entries with decreasing values of alMatrixTopNOctetRate until index N is assigned or there are no more alMatrixTopNEntries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.2,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The protocolDirLocalIndex of the network-layer protocol of this entry's network address.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.3,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNSourceAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The network-layer address of the source host in this conversation. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the associated alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex. For example, if the alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of IP, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.4,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNDestAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The network-layer address of the destination host in this conversation. This is represented as an octet string with specific semantics and length as identified by the associated alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex. For example, if the alMatrixTopNProtocolDirLocalIndex indicates an encapsulation of IP, this object is encoded as a length octet of 4, followed by the 4 octets of the IP address, in network byte order.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.5,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNAppProtocolDirLocalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The type of the protocol counted by this matrix entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.6,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNPktRate,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets seen of this protocol from the source host to the destination host during this sampling interval, counted using the rules for counting the alMatrixSDPkts object. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, this variable will be used to sort this report.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.7,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNReversePktRate,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of packets seen of this protocol from the destination host to the source host during this sampling interval, counted using the rules for counting the alMatrixDSPkts object. (Note that the corresponding alMatrixSDPkts object selected is the one whose source address is equal to alMatrixTopNDestAddress and whose destination address is equal to alMatrixTopNSourceAddress.) Note that if the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsPkts or alMatrixTopNAllPkts, the sort of topN entries is based entirely on alMatrixTopNPktRate, and not on the value of this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.8,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNOctetRate,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets seen of this protocol from the source host to the destination host during this sampling interval, counted using the rules for counting the alMatrixSDOctets object. If the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, this variable will be used to sort this report.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.17.4.1.9,RMON2-MIB::alMatrixTopNReverseOctetRate,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The number of octets seen of this protocol from the destination host to the source host during this sampling interval, counted using the rules for counting the alMatrixDSOctets object. (Note that the corresponding alMatrixSDOctets object selected is the one whose source address is equal to alMatrixTopNDestAddress and whose destination address is equal to alMatrixTopNSourceAddress.) Note that if the value of alMatrixTopNControlRateBase is equal to alMatrixTopNTerminalsOctets or alMatrixTopNAllOctets, the sort of topN entries is based entirely on alMatrixTopNOctetRate, and not on the value of this object.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of data-collection configuration entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex,current,,A list of parameters that set up a group of user-defined MIB objects to be sampled periodically (called a bucket-group). For example, an instance of usrHistoryControlInterval might be named usrHistoryControlInterval.1
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies an entry in the usrHistoryControlTable. Each such entry defines a set of samples at a particular interval for a specified set of MIB instances available from the managed system.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlObjects,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The number of MIB objects to be collected in the portion of usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. This object may not be modified if the associated instance of usrHistoryControlStatus is equal to active(1).

When this object is created or modified, the probe should set usrHistoryControlBucketsGranted as closely to this object as possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. DEFVAL { 50 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.4,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlBucketsGranted,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The number of discrete sampling intervals over which data shall be saved in the part of the usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. When the associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object is created or modified, the probe should set this object as closely to the requested value as possible for the particular probe implementation and available resources. The probe must not lower this value except as a result of a modification to the associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object. The associated usrHistoryControlBucketsRequested object should be set before or at the same time as this object to allow the probe to accurately estimate the resources required for this usrHistoryControlEntry. There will be times when the actual number of buckets associated with this entry is less than the value of this object. In this case, at the end of each sampling interval, a new bucket will be added to the usrHistoryTable. When the number of buckets reaches the value of this object and a new bucket is to be added to the usrHistoryTable, the oldest bucket associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry shall be deleted by the agent so that the new bucket can be added. When the value of this object changes to a value less than the current value, entries are deleted from the usrHistoryTable associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. Enough of the oldest of these entries shall be deleted by the agent so that their number remains less than or equal to the new value of this object. When the value of this object changes to a value greater than the current value, the number of associated usrHistory entries may be allowed to grow.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.5,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlInterval,Integer32,read-create,,current,,The interval in seconds over which the data is sampled for each bucket in the part of the usrHistory table associated with this usrHistoryControlEntry. Because the counters in a bucket may overflow at their maximum value with no indication, a prudent manager will take into account the possibility of overflow in any of the associated counters. It is important to consider the minimum time in which any counter could overflow on a particular media type and to set the usrHistoryControlInterval object to a value less than this interval. This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1). DEFVAL { 1800 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.1.1.6,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryControlOwner,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The entity that configured this entry and is therefore using the resources assigned to it.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex:usrHistoryObjectIndex,current,,A list of MIB instances to be sampled periodically. Entries in this table are created when an associated usrHistoryControlObjects object is created. The usrHistoryControlIndex value in the index is that of the associated usrHistoryControlEntry. For example, an instance of usrHistoryObjectVariable might be usrHistoryObjectVariable.1.3
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index used to uniquely identify an entry in the usrHistoryObject table. Each such entry defines a MIB instance to be collected periodically.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectVariable,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,The object identifier of the particular variable to be sampled. Only variables that resolve to an ASN.1 primitive type of Integer32 (Integer32, Counter, Gauge, or TimeTicks) may be sampled. Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms of the contents of MIB views, no access control mechanism exists that can restrict the value of this object to identify only those objects that exist in a particular MIB view. Because there is thus no acceptable means of restricting the read access that could be obtained through the user history mechanism, the probe must only grant write access to this object in those views that have read access to all objects on the probe. See USM [RFC3414] and VACM [RFC3415] for more information. During a set operation, if the supplied variable name is not available in the selected MIB view, a badValue error must be returned. This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.2.1.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryObjectSampleType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,absoluteValue(1):deltaValue(2),The method of sampling the selected variable for storage in the usrHistoryTable. If the value of this object is absoluteValue(1), the value of the selected variable will be copied directly into the history bucket. If the value of this object is deltaValue(2), the value of the selected variable at the last sample will be subtracted from the current value, and the difference will be stored in the history bucket. If the associated usrHistoryObjectVariable instance could not be obtained at the previous sample interval, then a delta sample is not possible, and the value of the associated usrHistoryValStatus object for this interval will be valueNotAvailable(1). This object may not be modified if the associated usrHistoryControlStatus object is equal to active(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A list of user-defined history entries.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryEntry,,not-accessible,usrHistoryControlIndex:usrHistorySampleIndex:usrHistoryObjectIndex,current,,A historical sample of user-defined variables. This sample is associated with the usrHistoryControlEntry that set up the parameters for a regular collection of these samples. The usrHistoryControlIndex value in the index identifies the usrHistoryControlEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. The usrHistoryObjectIndex value in the index identifies the usrHistoryObjectEntry on whose behalf this entry was created. For example, an instance of usrHistoryAbsValue, which represents the 14th sample of a variable collected as specified by usrHistoryControlEntry.1 and usrHistoryObjectEntry.1.5, would be named usrHistoryAbsValue.1.14.5
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.1,RMON2-MIB::usrHistorySampleIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,An index that uniquely identifies the particular sample this entry represents among all samples associated with the same usrHistoryControlEntry. This index starts at 1 and increases by one as each new sample is taken.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.2,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryIntervalStart,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the start of the interval over which this sample was measured. If the probe keeps track of the time of day, it should start the first sample of the history at a time such that when the next hour of the day begins, a sample is started at that instant. Note that following this rule may require that the probe delay collecting the first sample of the history, as each sample must be of the same interval. Also note that the sample that is currently being collected is not accessible in this table until the end of its interval.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.3,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryIntervalEnd,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the end of the interval over which this sample was measured.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.4,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryAbsValue,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,The absolute value (i.e., unsigned value) of the user-specified statistic during the last sampling period. The value during the current sampling period is not made available until the period is completed. To obtain the true value for this sampling interval, the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus must be checked, and usrHistoryAbsValue adjusted as necessary. If the MIB instance could not be accessed during the sampling interval, then this object will have a value of zero, and the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus will be set to 'valueNotAvailable(1)'. The access control check prescribed in the definition of usrHistoryObjectVariable SHOULD be checked for each sampling interval. If this check determines that access should not be allowed, then this object will have a value of zero, and the associated instance of usrHistoryValStatus will be set to 'valueNotAvailable(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.18.3.1.5,RMON2-MIB::usrHistoryValStatus,INTEGER,read-only,,current,valueNotAvailable(1):valuePositive(2):valueNegative(3),This object indicates the validity and sign of the data in the associated instance of usrHistoryAbsValue. If the MIB instance could not be accessed during the sampling interval, then 'valueNotAvailable(1)' will be returned. If the sample is valid and the actual value of the sample is greater than or equal to zero, then 'valuePositive(2)' is returned. If the sample is valid and the actual value of the sample is less than zero, 'valueNegative(3)' will be returned. The associated instance of usrHistoryAbsValue should be multiplied by -1 to obtain the true sample value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19,RMON2-MIB::probeConfig,,,,,,

.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.5,RMON2-MIB::probeResetControl,INTEGER,read-write,,current,running(1):warmBoot(2):coldBoot(3),Setting this object to warmBoot(2) causes the device to restart the application software with current configuration parameters saved in non-volatile memory. Setting this object to coldBoot(3) causes the device to reinitialize configuration parameters in non-volatile memory to default values and to restart the application software. When the device is running normally, this variable has a value of running(1).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.6,RMON2-MIB::probeDownloadFile,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The file name to be downloaded from the TFTP server when a download is next requested via this MIB. This value is set to the zero-length string when no file name has been specified. This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.7,RMON2-MIB::probeDownloadTFTPServer,IpAddress,read-write,,deprecated,,The IP address of the TFTP server that contains the boot image to load when a download is next requested via this MIB. This value is set to '0.0.0.0' when no IP address has been specified. This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.8,RMON2-MIB::probeDownloadAction,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,notDownloading(1):downloadToPROM(2):downloadToRAM(3),When this object is set to downloadToRAM(3) or downloadToPROM(2), the device will discontinue its normal operation and begin download of the image specified by probeDownloadFile from the server specified by probeDownloadTFTPServer using the TFTP protocol. If downloadToRAM(3) is specified, the new image is copied to RAM only (the old image remains unaltered in the flash EPROM). If downloadToPROM(2) is specified, the new image is written to the flash EPROM memory after its checksum has been verified to be correct. When the download process is completed, the device will warm boot to restart the newly loaded application. When the device is not downloading, this object will have a value of notDownloading(1). This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.

This object will have a value of downloadStatusUnknown(2) if no download process has been performed. This object has been deprecated, as it has not had enough independent implementations to demonstrate interoperability to meet the requirements of a Draft Standard.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.16.19.10,RMON2-MIB::serialConfigTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,A table of serial interface configuration entries. This data will be stored in non-volatile memory and preserved across probe resets or power loss.

This table is provided as a way to read 64-bit counters for agents that support only SNMPv1. Note that the reporting of most-significant and least-significant counter bits separately runs the risk of missing an overflow of the lower bits in the interval between sampling. The manager must be aware of this possibility, even within the same varbindlist, when interpreting the results of a request or asynchronous notification.

The value of zero in this table, as the port number from which frames with a specific destination address are received, is used to specify all ports for which there is no specific entry in this table for that particular destination address. Entries are valid for unicast and for group/broadcast addresses.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.5.1.1,BRIDGE-MIB::dot1dStaticEntry,,not-accessible,dot1dStaticAddress:dot1dStaticReceivePort,current,,Filtering information configured into the bridge by (local or network) management specifying the set of ports to which frames received from a specific port and containing a specific destination address are allowed to be forwarded.

Each octet within the value of this object specifies a set of eight ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through 8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc. Within each octet, the most significant bit represents the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit represents the highest numbered port. Thus, each port of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the value of this object. If that bit has a value of '1', then that port is included in the set of ports; the port is not included if its bit has a value of '0'. (Note that the setting of the bit corresponding to the port from which a frame is received is irrelevant.) The default value of this object is a string of ones of appropriate length. The value of this object may exceed the required minimum maximum message size of some SNMP transport (484 bytes, in the case of SNMP over UDP, see RFC 3417, section 3.2).

Changes to a bit in this object affect the per-port, per-VLAN Registrar control for Registration Fixed for the relevant GVRP state machine on each port. A port may not be added in this set if it is already a member of the set of ports in dot1qVlanForbiddenEgressPorts. The default value of this object is a string of zeros of appropriate length, indicating not fixed.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.17.7.1.4.3.1.3,Q-BRIDGE-MIB::dot1qVlanForbiddenEgressPorts,OCTET,read-create,,current,,The set of ports that are prohibited by management from being included in the egress list for this VLAN. Changes to this object that cause a port to be included or excluded affect the per-port, per-VLAN Registrar control for Registration Forbidden for the relevant GVRP state machine on each port.

This will report values >=4096 if a new Local VLAN may be created or else the value 0 if this is not possible. A row creation operation in this table for an entry with a local VlanIndex value may fail if the current value of this object is not used as the index. Even if the value read is used, there is no guarantee that it will still be the valid index when the create operation is attempted; another manager may have already got in during the intervening time interval. In this case, dot1qNextFreeLocalVlanIndex should be re-read and the creation re-tried with the new value. This value will automatically change when the current value is used to create a new row.

The value enabled(1) indicates that GVRP is enabled on this port, as long as dot1qGvrpStatus is also enabled for this device. When disabled(2) but dot1qGvrpStatus is still enabled for the device, GVRP is disabled on this port: any GVRP packets received will be silently discarded, and no GVRP registrations will be propagated from other ports. This object affects all GVRP Applicant and Registrar state machines on this port. A transition from disabled(2) to enabled(1) will cause a reset of all GVRP state machines on this port. The value of this object MUST be retained across reinitializations of the management system. DEFVAL { enabled }

Separate objects are provided for both the most-significant and least-significant bits of statistics counters for ports that are associated with this transparent bridge. The most-significant bit objects are only required on high-capacity interfaces, as defined in the conformance clauses for these objects. This mechanism is provided as a way to read 64-bit counters for agents that support only SNMPv1. Note that the reporting of most-significant and least- significant counter bits separately runs the risk of missing an overflow of the lower bits in the interval between sampling. The manager must be aware of this possibility, even within the same varbindlist, when interpreting the results of a request or asynchronous notification.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.14,IF-MIB::ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable,INTEGER,read-write,,current,enabled(1):disabled(2),Indicates whether linkUp/linkDown traps should be generated for this interface. By default, this object should have the value enabled(1) for interfaces which do not operate on 'top' of any other interface (as defined in the ifStackTable), and disabled(2) otherwise.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.15,IF-MIB::ifHighSpeed,Gauge32,read-only,,current,,An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in units of 1,000,000 bits per second. If this object reports a value of `n' then the speed of the interface is somewhere in the range of `n-500,000' to `n+499,999'. For interfaces which do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. For a sub-layer which has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.16,IF-MIB::ifPromiscuousMode,INTEGER,read-write,,current,true(1):false(2),This object has a value of false(2) if this interface only accepts packets/frames that are addressed to this station. This object has a value of true(1) when the station accepts all packets/frames transmitted on the media. The value true(1) is only legal on certain types of media. If legal, setting this object to a value of true(1) may require the interface to be reset before becoming effective. The value of ifPromiscuousMode does not affect the reception of broadcast and multicast packets/frames by the interface.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.18,IF-MIB::ifAlias,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the interface. On the first instantiation of an interface, the value of ifAlias associated with that interface is the zero-length string. As and when a value is written into an instance of ifAlias through a network management set operation, then the agent must retain the supplied value in the ifAlias instance associated with the same interface for as long as that interface remains instantiated, including across all re- initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those which result in a change of the interface's ifIndex value. An example of the value which a network manager might store in this object for a WAN interface is the (Telco's) circuit number/identifier of the interface. Some agents may support write-access only for interfaces having particular values of ifType. An agent which supports write access to this object is required to keep the value in non-volatile storage, but it may limit the length of new values depending on how much storage is already occupied by the current values for other interfaces.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.19,IF-MIB::ifCounterDiscontinuityTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime on the most recent occasion at which any one or more of this interface's counters suffered a discontinuity. The relevant counters are the specific instances associated with this interface of any Counter32 or Counter64 object contained in the ifTable or ifXTable. If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re- initialization of the local management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The table containing information on the relationships between the multiple sub-layers of network interfaces. In particular, it contains information on which sub-layers run 'on top of' which other sub-layers, where each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable. For example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex value x runs over the sub-layer with ifIndex value y, then this table contains: ifStackStatus.x.y=active For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies an active interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows in this table associated with I. For one of these rows, I is the value of ifStackHigherLayer; for the other, I is the value of ifStackLowerLayer. (If I is not involved in multiplexing, then these are the only two rows associated with I.) For example, two rows exist even for an interface which has no others stacked on top or below it: ifStackStatus.0.x=active ifStackStatus.x.0=active 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1,IF-MIB::ifStackEntry,,not-accessible,ifStackHigherLayer:ifStackLowerLayer,current,,Information on a particular relationship between two sub- layers, specifying that one sub-layer runs on 'top' of the other sub-layer. Each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row in the ifTable.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.1,IF-MIB::ifStackHigherLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the higher sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs on 'top' of the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackLowerLayer. If there is no higher sub-layer (below the internetwork layer), then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.2,IF-MIB::ifStackLowerLayer,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of ifIndex corresponding to the lower sub-layer of the relationship, i.e., the sub-layer which runs 'below' the sub-layer identified by the corresponding instance of ifStackHigherLayer. If there is no lower sub-layer, then this object has the value 0.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.2.1.3,IF-MIB::ifStackStatus,INTEGER,read-create,,current,active(1):notInService(2):notReady(3):createAndGo(4):createAndWait(5):destroy(6),The status of the relationship between two sub-layers. Changing the value of this object from 'active' to 'notInService' or 'destroy' will likely have consequences up and down the interface stack. Thus, write access to this object is likely to be inappropriate for some types of interfaces, and many implementations will choose not to support write-access for any type of interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,This table contains one entry per interface. It defines objects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent to test an interface for various faults. Tests for an interface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that interface. After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult can be read to determine the outcome. If an agent can not perform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate. The object ifTestCode can be used to provide further test- specific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific) information concerning the outcome of the test. Only one test can be in progress on each interface at any one time. If one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the second test is rejected. Some agents may reject a test when a prior test is active on another interface. Before starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain 'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the interface to be tested. This is accomplished with the ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows: try_again: get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) while (ifTestStatus != notInUse) /* * Loop while a test is running or some other * manager is configuring a test. */ short delay get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus) } /* * Is not being used right now -- let's compete * to see who gets it. */ lock_value = ifTestId if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse, ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE) /* * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go * try again */ goto try_again; /* * I have the lock */ set up any test parameters. /* * This starts the test */ set(ifTestType = test_to_run); wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse' retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid A manager station first retrieves the value of the appropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically repeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of ifTestStatus is 'notInUse'. The manager station then tries to set the same ifTestId object to the value it just retrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the corresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating itself. If the set operation succeeds then the manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the ifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the semantics of TestAndIncr). Failure of the set operation indicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of the ifTestEntry. Once ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be setup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType. On completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to 'notInUse'. Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the results. In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests by two network managers were to overlap, then there would be a possibility that the first test's results might be overwritten by the second test's results prior to the first results being read. This unlikely circumstance ca
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1,IF-MIB::ifTestEntry,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,An entry containing objects for invoking tests on an interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.1,IF-MIB::ifTestId,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,,This object identifies the current invocation of the interface's test.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.2,IF-MIB::ifTestStatus,INTEGER,read-write,,deprecated,notInUse(1):inUse(2),This object indicates whether or not some manager currently has the necessary 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface. A write to this object is only successful when it changes its value from 'notInUse(1)' to 'inUse(2)'. After completion of a test, the agent resets the value back to 'notInUse(1)'.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.3,IF-MIB::ifTestType,OBJECT,read-write,,deprecated,,A control variable used to start and stop operator- initiated interface tests. Most OBJECT IDENTIFIER values assigned to tests are defined elsewhere, in association with specific types of interface. However, this document assigns a value for a full-duplex loopback test, and defines the special meanings of the subject identifier: noTest OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } When the value noTest is written to this object, no action is taken unless a test is in progress, in which case the test is aborted. Writing any other value to this object is only valid when no test is currently in progress, in which case the indicated test is initiated. When read, this object always returns the most recent value that ifTestType was set to. If it has not been set since the last initialization of the network management subsystem on the agent, a value of noTest is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.4,IF-MIB::ifTestResult,INTEGER,read-only,,deprecated,none(1):success(2):inProgress(3):notSupported(4):unAbleToRun(5):aborted(6):failed(7),This object contains the result of the most recently requested test, or the value none(1) if no tests have been requested since the last reset. Note that this facility provides no provision for saving the results of one test when starting another, as could be required if used by multiple managers concurrently.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.5,IF-MIB::ifTestCode,OBJECT,read-only,,deprecated,,This object contains a code which contains more specific information on the test result, for example an error-code after a failed test. Error codes and other values this object may take are specific to the type of interface and/or test. The value may have the semantics of either the AutonomousType or InstancePointer textual conventions as defined in RFC 2579. The identifier: testCodeUnknown OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 0 0 } is defined for use if no additional result code is available.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.3.1.6,IF-MIB::ifTestOwner,OCTET,read-write,,deprecated,,The entity which currently has the 'ownership' required to invoke a test on this interface.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains an entry for each address (broadcast, multicast, or uni-cast) for which the system will receive packets/frames on a particular interface, except as follows: - for an interface operating in promiscuous mode, entries are only required for those addresses for which the system would receive frames were it not operating in promiscuous mode. - for 802.5 functional addresses, only one entry is required, for the address which has the functional address bit ANDed with the bit mask of all functional addresses for which the interface will accept frames. A system is normally able to use any unicast address which corresponds to an entry in this table as a source address.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.4.1.3,IF-MIB::ifRcvAddressType,INTEGER,read-create,,current,other(1):volatile(2):nonVolatile(3),This object has the value nonVolatile(3) for those entries in the table which are valid and will not be deleted by the next restart of the managed system. Entries having the value volatile(2) are valid and exist, but have not been saved, so that will not exist after the next restart of the managed system. Entries having the value other(1) are valid and exist but are not classified as to whether they will continue to exist after the next restart. DEFVAL { volatile }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.5,IF-MIB::ifTableLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time of the last creation or deletion of an entry in the ifTable. If the number of entries has been unchanged since the last re-initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.6,IF-MIB::ifStackLastChange,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time of the last change of the (whole) interface stack. A change of the interface stack is defined to be any creation, deletion, or change in value of any instance of ifStackStatus.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one row per physical entity. There is always at least one row for an 'overall' physical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular physical entity. Each entry provides objects (entPhysicalDescr, entPhysicalVendorType, and entPhysicalClass) to help an NMS identify and characterize the entry and objects (entPhysicalContainedIn and entPhysicalParentRelPos) to help an NMS relate the particular entry to other entries in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The index for this entry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of physical entity. This object should contain a string that identifies the manufacturer's name for the physical entity and should be set to a distinct value for each version or model of the physical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalVendorType,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,An indication of the vendor-specific hardware type of the physical entity. Note that this is different from the definition of MIB-II's sysObjectID. An agent should set this object to an enterprise-specific registration identifier value indicating the specific equipment type in detail. The associated instance of entPhysicalClass is used to indicate the general type of hardware device. If no vendor-specific registration identifier exists for this physical entity, or the value is unknown by this agent, then the value { 0 0 } is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.4,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainedIn,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of entPhysicalIndex for the physical entity that 'contains' this physical entity. A value of zero indicates this physical entity is not contained in any other physical entity. Note that the set of 'containment' relationships define a strict hierarchy; that is, recursion is not allowed. In the event that a physical entity is contained by more than one physical entity (e.g., double-wide modules), this object should identify the containing entity with the lowest value of entPhysicalIndex.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.5,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalClass,INTEGER,read-only,,current,other(1):unknown(2):chassis(3):backplane(4):container(5):powerSupply(6):fan(7):sensor(8):module(9):port(10):stack(11):cpu(12):energyObject(13):battery(14):storageDrive(15),An indication of the general hardware type of the physical entity. An agent should set this object to the standard enumeration value that most accurately indicates the general class of the physical entity, or the primary class if there is more than one entity. If no appropriate standard registration identifier exists for this physical entity, then the value 'other(1)' is returned. If the value is unknown by this agent, then the value 'unknown(2)' is returned.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.6,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalParentRelPos,Integer32,read-only,,current,,An indication of the relative position of this 'child' component among all its 'sibling' components. Sibling components are defined as entPhysicalEntries that share the same instance values of each of the entPhysicalContainedIn and entPhysicalClass objects. An NMS can use this object to identify the relative ordering for all sibling components of a particular parent (identified by the entPhysicalContainedIn instance in each sibling entry). If possible, this value should match any external labeling of the physical component. For example, for a container (e.g., card slot) labeled as 'slot #3', entPhysicalParentRelPos should have the value '3'. Note that the entPhysicalEntry for the module plugged in slot 3 should have an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '1'. If the physical position of this component does not match any external numbering or clearly visible ordering, then user documentation or other external reference material should be used to determine the parent-relative position. If this is not possible, then the agent should assign a consistent (but possibly arbitrary) ordering to a given set of 'sibling' components, perhaps based on internal representation of the components. If the agent cannot determine the parent-relative position for some reason, or if the associated value of entPhysicalContainedIn is '0', then the value '-1' is returned. Otherwise, a non-negative integer is returned, indicating the parent-relative position of this physical entity. Parent-relative ordering normally starts from '1' and continues to 'N', where 'N' represents the highest positioned child entity. However, if the physical entities (e.g., slots) are labeled from a starting position of zero, then the first sibling should be associated with an entPhysicalParentRelPos value of '0'. Note that this ordering may be sparse or dense, depending on agent implementation. The actual values returned are not globally meaningful, as each 'parent' component may use different numbering algorithms. The ordering is only meaningful among siblings of the same parent component. The agent should retain parent-relative position values across reboots, either through algorithmic assignment or use of non-volatile storage.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.7,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The textual name of the physical entity. The value of this object should be the name of the component as assigned by the local device and should be suitable for use in commands entered at the device's 'console'. This might be a text name (e.g., 'console') or a simple component number (e.g., port or module number, such as '1'), depending on the physical component naming syntax of the device. If there is no local name, or if this object is otherwise not applicable, then this object contains a zero-length string. Note that the value of entPhysicalName for two physical entities will be the same in the event that the console interface does not distinguish between them, e.g., slot-1 and the card in slot-1.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.8,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalHardwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific hardware revision string for the physical entity. The preferred value is the hardware revision identifier actually printed on the component itself (if present). Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific hardware revision string is associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.9,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalFirmwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific firmware revision string for the physical entity. Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific firmware programs are associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.10,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalSoftwareRev,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific software revision string for the physical entity. Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (e.g., binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific software programs are associated with the physical component, or if this information is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.11,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalSerialNum,OCTET,read-write,,current,,The vendor-specific serial number string for the physical entity. The preferred value is the serial number string actually printed on the component itself (if present). On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalSerialNum associated with that entity is set to the correct vendor-assigned serial number, if this information is available to the agent. If a serial number is unknown or non-existent, the entPhysicalSerialNum will be set to a zero-length string instead. Note that implementations that can correctly identify the serial numbers of all installed physical entities do not need to provide write access to the entPhysicalSerialNum object. Agents that cannot provide non-volatile storage for the entPhysicalSerialNum strings are not required to implement write access for this object. Not every physical component will have a serial number, or even need one. Physical entities for which the associated value of the entPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)' (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module) do not need their own unique serial numbers. An agent does not have to provide write access for such entities and may return a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalSerialNum and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalSerialNum instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.12,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalMfgName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The name of the manufacturer of this physical component. The preferred value is the manufacturer name string actually printed on the component itself (if present). Note that comparisons between instances of the entPhysicalModelName, entPhysicalFirmwareRev, entPhysicalSoftwareRev, and the entPhysicalSerialNum objects are only meaningful amongst entPhysicalEntries with the same value of entPhysicalMfgName. If the manufacturer name string associated with the physical component is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.13,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalModelName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The vendor-specific model name identifier string associated with this physical component. The preferred value is the customer-visible part number, which may be printed on the component itself. If the model name string associated with the physical component is unknown to the agent, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.14,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalAlias,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is an 'alias' name for the physical entity, as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the physical entity. On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalAlias associated with that entity is set to the zero-length string. However, the agent may set the value to a locally unique default value, instead of a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalAlias and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalAlias instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.15,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalAssetID,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object is a user-assigned asset tracking identifier (as specified by a network manager) for the physical entity and provides non-volatile storage of this information. On the first instantiation of a physical entity, the value of entPhysicalAssetID associated with that entity is set to the zero-length string. Not every physical component will have an asset tracking identifier or even need one. Physical entities for which the associated value of the entPhysicalIsFRU object is equal to 'false(2)' (e.g., the repeater ports within a repeater module) do not need their own unique asset tracking identifier. An agent does not have to provide write access for such entities and may instead return a zero-length string. If write access is implemented for an instance of entPhysicalAssetID and a value is written into the instance, the agent must retain the supplied value in the entPhysicalAssetID instance (associated with the same physical entity) for as long as that entity remains instantiated. This includes instantiations across all re-initializations/reboots of the network management system, including those resulting in a change of the physical entity's entPhysicalIndex value. If no asset tracking information is associated with the physical component, then this object will contain a zero-length string.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.16,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalIsFRU,INTEGER,read-only,,current,true(1):false(2),This object indicates whether or not this physical entity is considered a 'field replaceable unit' by the vendor. If this object contains the value 'true(1)', then this entPhysicalEntry identifies a field replaceable unit. For all entPhysicalEntries that represent components permanently contained within a field replaceable unit, the value 'false(2)' should be returned for this object.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.17,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalMfgDate,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object contains the date of manufacturing of the managed entity. If the manufacturing date is unknown or not supported, the object is not instantiated. The special value '0000000000000000'H may also be returned in this case.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.18,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalUris,OCTET,read-write,,current,,This object contains identification information about the physical entity. The object contains URIs; therefore, the syntax of this object must conform to RFC 3986, Section 3. Multiple URIs may be present and are separated by white space characters. Leading and trailing white space characters are ignored. If no URI identification information is known about the physical entity, the object is not instantiated. A zero-length octet string may also be returned in this case.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.19,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalUUID,OCTET,read-only,,current,,This object contains identification information about the physical entity. The object contains a Universally Unique Identifier, the syntax of this object must conform to RFC 4122, Section 4.1. A zero-length octet string is returned if no UUID information is known.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entityLogical,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains one row per logical entity. For agents that implement more than one naming scope, at least one entry must exist. Agents that instantiate all MIB objects within a single naming scope are not required to implement this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalEntry,,not-accessible,entLogicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular logical entity. Entities may be managed by this agent or other SNMP agents (possibly) in the same chassis.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalIndex,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of this object uniquely identifies the logical entity. The value should be a small positive integer; index values for different logical entities are not necessarily contiguous.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalDescr,OCTET,read-only,,current,,A textual description of the logical entity. This object should contain a string that identifies the manufacturer's name for the logical entity and should be set to a distinct value for each version of the logical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalType,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,An indication of the type of logical entity. This will typically be the OBJECT IDENTIFIER name of the node in the SMI's naming hierarchy that represents the major MIB module, or the majority of the MIB modules, supported by the logical entity. For example: a logical entity of a regular host/router -> mib-2 a logical entity of a 802.1d bridge -> dot1dBridge a logical entity of a 802.3 repeater -> snmpDot3RptrMgmt If an appropriate node in the SMI's naming hierarchy cannot be identified, the value 'mib-2' should be used.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.4,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalCommunity,OCTET,read-only,,deprecated,,An SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c community string, which can be used to access detailed management information for this logical entity. The agent should allow read access with this community string (to an appropriate subset of all managed objects) and may also return a community string based on the privileges of the request used to read this object. Note that an agent may return a community string with read-only privileges, even if this object is accessed with a read-write community string. However, the agent must take care not to return a community string that allows more privileges than the community string used to access this object. A compliant SNMP agent may wish to conserve naming scopes by representing multiple logical entities in a single 'default' naming scope. This is possible when the logical entities, represented by the same value of entLogicalCommunity, have no object instances in common. For example, 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' may be part of the main naming scope, but at least one additional community string is needed to represent 'bridge2' and 'repeater2'. Logical entities 'bridge1' and 'repeater1' would be represented by sysOREntries associated with the 'default' naming scope. For agents not accessible via SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c, the value of this object is the empty string. This object may also contain an empty string if a community string has not yet been assigned by the agent or if no community string with suitable access rights can be returned for a particular SNMP request. Note that this object is deprecated. Agents that implement SNMPv3 access should use the entLogicalContextEngineID and entLogicalContextName objects to identify the context associated with each logical entity. SNMPv3 agents may return a zero-length string for this object or may continue to return a community string (e.g., tri-lingual agent support).
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.5,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTAddress,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The transport service address by which the logical entity receives network management traffic, formatted according to the corresponding value of entLogicalTDomain. For snmpUDPDomain, a TAddress is 6 octets long: the initial 4 octets contain the IP-address in network-byte order, and the last 2 contain the UDP port in network-byte order. Consult RFC 3417 for further information on snmpUDPDomain.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.6,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalTDomain,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,Indicates the kind of transport service by which the logical entity receives network management traffic. Possible values for this object are presently found in RFC 3417.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.7,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalContextEngineID,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The authoritative contextEngineID that can be used to send an SNMP message concerning information held by this logical entity to the address specified by the associated 'entLogicalTAddress/entLogicalTDomain' pair. This object, together with the associated entLogicalContextName object, defines the context associated with a particular logical entity and allows access to SNMP engines identified by a contextEngineID and contextName pair. If no value has been configured by the agent, a zero-length string is returned, or the agent may choose not to instantiate this object at all.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.2.1.1.8,ENTITY-MIB::entLogicalContextName,OCTET,read-only,,current,,The contextName that can be used to send an SNMP message concerning information held by this logical entity to the address specified by the associated 'entLogicalTAddress/entLogicalTDomain' pair. This object, together with the associated entLogicalContextEngineID object, defines the context associated with a particular logical entity and allows access to SNMP engines identified by a contextEngineID and contextName pair. If no value has been configured by the agent, a zero-length string is returned, or the agent may choose not to instantiate this object at all.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3,ENTITY-MIB::entityMapping,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPMappingTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains zero or more rows of logical entity to physical equipment associations. For each logical entity known by this agent, there are zero or more mappings to the physical resources, which are used to realize that logical entity. An agent should limit the number and nature of entries in this table such that only meaningful and non-redundant information is returned. For example, in a system that contains a single power supply, mappings between logical entities and the power supply are not useful and should not be included. Also, only the most appropriate physical component, which is closest to the root of a particular containment tree, should be identified in an entLPMapping entry. For example, suppose a bridge is realized on a particular module, and all ports on that module are ports on this bridge. A mapping between the bridge and the module would be useful, but additional mappings between the bridge and each of the ports on that module would be redundant (because the entPhysicalContainedIn hierarchy can provide the same information). On the other hand, if more than one bridge were utilizing ports on this module, then mappings between each bridge and the ports it used would be appropriate. Also, in the case of a single backplane repeater, a mapping for the backplane to the single repeater entity is not necessary.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPMappingEntry,,not-accessible,entLogicalIndex:entLPPhysicalIndex,current,,Information about a particular logical-entity-to-physical- equipment association. Note that the nature of the association is not specifically identified in this entry. It is expected that sufficient information exists in the MIB modules used to manage a particular logical entity to infer how physical component information is utilized.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.1.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLPPhysicalIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of this object identifies the index value of a particular entPhysicalEntry associated with the indicated entLogicalEntity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table contains zero or more rows, representing mappings of logical entities and physical components to external MIB identifiers. Each physical port in the system may be associated with a mapping to an external identifier, which itself is associated with a particular logical entity's naming scope. A 'wildcard' mechanism is provided to indicate that an identifier is associated with more than one logical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex:entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero,current,,Information about a particular binding between a logical entity/physical component pair and an external identifier. Each logical entity/physical component pair may be associated with one alias mapping. The logical entity index may also be used as a 'wildcard' (refer to the entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero objectclause for details.) Note that only entPhysicalIndex values that represent physical ports (i.e., associated entPhysicalClass value is 'port(10)') are permitted to exist in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero,Integer32,not-accessible,,current,,The value of this object identifies the logical entity that defines the naming scope for the associated instance of the entAliasMappingIdentifier object. If this object has a non-zero value, then it identifies the logical entity named by the same value of entLogicalIndex. If this object has a value of zero, then the mapping between the physical component and the alias identifier for this entAliasMapping entry is associated with all unspecified logical entities. That is, a value of zero (the default mapping) identifies any logical entity that does not have an explicit entry in this table for a particular entPhysicalIndex/entAliasMappingIdentifier pair. For example, to indicate that a particular interface (e.g., physical component 33) is identified by the same value of ifIndex for all logical entities, the following instance might exist: entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.5 In the event an entPhysicalEntry is associated differently for some logical entities, additional entAliasMapping entries may exist, e.g.: entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.0 = ifIndex.6 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.4 = ifIndex.1 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.5 = ifIndex.1 entAliasMappingIdentifier.33.10 = ifIndex.12 Note that entries with non-zero entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero index values have precedence over zero-indexed entries. In this example, all logical entities except 4, 5, and 10 associate physical entity 33 with ifIndex.6.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1.2,ENTITY-MIB::entAliasMappingIdentifier,OBJECT,read-only,,current,,The value of this object identifies a particular conceptual row associated with the indicated entPhysicalIndex and entLogicalIndex pair. Because only physical ports are modeled in this table, only entries that represent interfaces or ports are allowed. If an ifEntry exists on behalf of a particular physical port, then this object should identify the associated ifEntry. For repeater ports, the appropriate row in the 'rptrPortGroupTable' should be identified instead. For example, suppose a physical port was represented by entPhysicalEntry.3, entLogicalEntry.15 existed for a repeater, and entLogicalEntry.22 existed for a bridge. Then there might be two related instances of entAliasMappingIdentifier: entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.15 == rptrPortGroupIndex.5.2 entAliasMappingIdentifier.3.22 == ifIndex.17 It is possible that other mappings (besides interfaces and repeater ports) may be defined in the future, as required. Bridge ports are identified by examining the Bridge MIB and appropriate ifEntries associated with each 'dot1dBasePort' and are thus not represented in this table.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainsTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table that exposes the container/'containee' relationships between physical entities. This table provides all the information found by constructing the virtual containment tree for a given entPhysicalTable, but in a more direct format. In the event a physical entity is contained by more than one other physical entity (e.g., double-wide modules), this table should include these additional mappings, which cannot be represented in the entPhysicalTable virtual containment tree.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalContainsEntry,,not-accessible,entPhysicalIndex:entPhysicalChildIndex,current,,A single container/'containee' relationship.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3.1.1,ENTITY-MIB::entPhysicalChildIndex,Integer32,read-only,,current,,The value of entPhysicalIndex for the contained physical entity.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.4,ENTITY-MIB::entityGeneral,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.4.1,ENTITY-MIB::entLastChangeTime,TimeTicks,read-only,,current,,The value of sysUpTime at the time a conceptual row is created, modified, or deleted in any of these tables: - entPhysicalTable - entLogicalTable - entLPMappingTable - entAliasMappingTable - entPhysicalContainsTable 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.2,ENTITY-MIB::entityMIBTraps,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.2.0,ENTITY-MIB::entityMIBTrapPrefix,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.2.0.1,ENTITY-MIB::entConfigChange,,,,,,An entConfigChange notification is generated when the value of entLastChangeTime changes. It can be utilized by an NMS to trigger logical/physical entity table maintenance polls. An agent should not generate more than one entConfigChange 'notification-event' in a given time interval (five seconds is the suggested default). A 'notification-event' is the transmission of a single trap or inform PDU to a list of notification destinations. If additional configuration changes occur within the throttling period, then notification-events for these changes should be suppressed by the agent until the current throttling period expires. At the end of a throttling period, one notification-event should be generated if any configuration changes occurred since the start of the throttling period. In such a case, another throttling period is started right away. An NMS should periodically check the value of entLastChangeTime to detect any missed entConfigChange notification-events, e.g., due to throttling or transmission loss.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.2,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperVirtualMacAddr,OCTET,read-only,,deprecated,,The virtual MAC address of the virtual router. Although  this object can be derived from the 'vrrpOperVrId' object,  it is defined so that it is easily obtainable by a  management application and can be included in VRRP-related  SNMP traps.  This object is deprecated in favor of the IP Version  Independent object, vrrpOperationsVirtualMacAddr.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.3,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperState,INTEGER,read-only,,deprecated,initialize(1):backup(2):master(3),The current state of the virtual router. This object has  three defined values:   - `initialize', which indicates that all the  virtual router is waiting for a startup event.   - `backup', which indicates the virtual router is  monitoring the availability of the master router.   - `master', which indicates that the virtual router  is forwarding packets for IP addresses that are  associated with this router.   Setting the `vrrpOperAdminState' object (below) initiates  transitions in the value of this object.   This object is deprecated in favor of the IP Version  Independent object, vrrpOperationsState.

If this object is set to 0.0.0.0, the IP address  which is numerically lowest (of all the associated IP  address for the interface) will be selected.   This object is deprecated in favor of the IP Version  Independent object, vrrpOperationsPrimaryIpAddr. DEFVAL { 0 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.9,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperAuthType,INTEGER,read-create,,deprecated,noAuthentication(1):simpleTextPassword(2):ipAuthenticationHeader(3),Authentication type used for VRRP protocol exchanges  between virtual routers. This value of this object is the  same for a given ifIndex.   New enumerations to this list can only be added via a new  RFC on the standards track.   This object is deprecated in the IP Version MIB. DEFVAL { noAuthentication }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.10,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperAuthKey,OCTET,read-create,,deprecated,,The Authentication Key. This object is set according to  the value of the 'vrrpOperAuthType' object  ('simpleTextPassword' or 'ipAuthenticationHeader'). If  the length of the value is less than 16 octets, the agent  will left adjust and zero fill to 16 octets. The value of  this object is the same for a given ifIndex.   When read, vrrpOperAuthKey always returns an Octet String  of length zero.   This object is deprecated in the IP Version MIB.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.11,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperAdvertisementInterval,Integer32,read-create,,deprecated,,The time interval, in seconds, between sending  advertisement messages. Only the master router sends  VRRP advertisements.   This object is deprecated in favor of the IP Version  Independent object, vrrpOperationsAdvInterval.  DEFVAL { 1 }
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.3.1.12,VRRP-MIB::vrrpOperPreemptMode,INTEGER,read-create,,deprecated,true(1):false(2),Controls whether a higher priority virtual router will  preempt a lower priority master.

The RowStatus of a currently active row in the  vrrpOperTable is constrained by the operational state of  the corresponding virtual router.  When `vrrpOperRowStatus' is set to active(1), no other  objects in the conceptual row, with the exception of  `vrrpOperAdminState', can be modified. Prior to setting  the `vrrpOperRowStatus' object from `active' to a  different value, the `vrrpOperAdminState' object must be  set to `down' and the `vrrpOperState' object be  transitioned to `initialize'.   To create a row in this table, a manager sets this object  to either createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5). Until  instances of all corresponding columns are appropriately  configured, the value of the corresponding instance of the  `vrrpOperRowStatus' column will be read as notReady(3).   In particular, a newly created row cannot be made  active(1) until (minimally) the corresponding instance of  `vrrpOperVrId' has been set and there is at least one  active row in the `vrrpAssoIpAddrTable' defining an  associated IP address for the virtual router.   This object is deprecated in favor of the IP Version  Independent object, vrrpOperationsRowStatus. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.4,VRRP-MIB::vrrpAssoIpAddrTable,,not-accessible,,deprecated,,The table of addresses associated with this virtual  router.  This object is deprecated in favor of the IP Version  Independent object, vrrpAssociatedIpAddrTable. 
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.4.1,VRRP-MIB::vrrpAssoIpAddrEntry,,not-accessible,ifIndex:vrrpOperVrId:vrrpAssoIpAddr,deprecated,,An entry in the table contains an IP address that is  associated with a virtual router. The number of rows for  a given ifIndex and VrId will equal the number of IP  addresses associated (e.g., backed up) by the virtual  router (equivalent to 'vrrpOperIpAddrCount').   Rows in the table cannot be modified unless the value  of `vrrpOperAdminState' is `disabled' and the  `vrrpOperState' has transitioned to `initialize'.   This object is deprecated in favor of the IP Version  Independent object, vrrpAssociatedIpAddrEntry.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.4.1.1,VRRP-MIB::vrrpAssoIpAddr,IpAddress,not-accessible,,deprecated,,The assigned IP addresses that a virtual router is  responsible for backing up.   This object is deprecated in favor of the IP Version  Independent object, vrrpAssociatedIpAddr.

Setting this  object to active(1) or createAndGo(4) results in the  addition of an associated address for a virtual router.  Destroying the entry or setting it to notInService(2)  removes the associated address from the virtual router.  The use of other values is implementation-dependent.   This object is deprecated in favor of the IP Version  Independent object, vrrpAssociatedIpAddrRowStatus.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.68.1.5,VRRP-MIB::vrrpTrapPacketSrc,IpAddress,accessible-for-notify,,deprecated,,The IP address of an inbound VRRP packet. Used by  vrrpTrapAuthFailure trap.   This object is deprecated in the IP Version MIB.

When `vrrpOperationsRowStatus' is set to  active(1), no other objects in the conceptual row can  be modified.   To create a row in this table, a manager sets this  object to either createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5).  Until instances of all corresponding columns are  appropriately configured, the value of the  corresponding instance of the `vrrpOperationsRowStatus'  column will be read as notReady(3).  In particular, a newly created row cannot be made  active(1) until (minimally) the corresponding instance  of vrrpOperationsInetAddrType, vrrpOperationsVrId and  vrrpOperationsPrimaryIpAddr has been set and there is  at least one active row in the  `vrrpAssociatedIpAddrTable' defining an associated  IP address.   notInService(2) should be used to administratively  bring the row down.   A typical order of operation to add a row is:  1. Create a row in vrrpOperationsTable with  createAndWait(5).  2. Create one or more corresponding rows in  vrrpAssociatedIpAddrTable.  3. Populate the vrrpOperationsEntry.  4. set vrrpOperationsRowStatus to active(1).   A typical order of operation to delete an entry is:  1. Set vrrpOperationsRowStatus to notInService(2).  2. Set the corresponding rows in  vrrpAssociatedIpAddrTable to destroy(6) to delete the  entry.  3. set vrrpOperationsRowStatus to destroy(6) to delete  the entry.

The number of rows  for a given IP version, VrID and ifIndex will equal the  number of IP addresses associated (e.g., backed up) by  the virtual router (equivalent to  'vrrpOperationsIpAddrCount').   Rows in the table cannot be modified unless the value  of `vrrpOperationsState' has transitioned to  `initialize'.

To create a row in this table, a manager sets  this object to either createAndGo(4) or  createAndWait(5). Setting this object to active(1)  results in the addition of an associated address for a  virtual router. Setting this object to notInService(2)  results in administratively bringing down the row.   Destroying the entry or setting it to destroy(6)  removes the associated address from the virtual router.  The use of other values is implementation-dependent.   Only vrrpAssociatedStorageType can be modified when the  row is in active(1) state for Implementations  supporting write access to vrrpAssociatedStorageType   Implementations should not allow deletion of the last  row corresponding to an active row in  vrrpOperationsTable.

These are associated with individual interfaces, logical or physical, and therefore are instantiated by ifIndex. Therefore, the interface index must have been assigned, according to the procedures applicable to that, before it can be meaningfully used. Generally, this means that the interface must exist. When diffServDataPathStorage is of type nonVolatile, however, this may reflect the configuration for an interface whose ifIndex has been assigned but for which the supporting implementation is not currently present.

.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.1.2.2,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServClfrTable,,not-accessible,,current,,This table enumerates all the diffserv classifier functional data path elements of this device. The actual classification definitions are defined in diffServClfrElementTable entries belonging to each classifier. An entry in this table, pointed to by a RowPointer specifying an instance of diffServClfrStatus, is frequently used as the name for a set of classifier elements, which all use the index diffServClfrId. Per the semantics of the classifier element table, these entries constitute one or more unordered sets of tests which may be simultaneously applied to a message to classify it. The primary function of this table is to ensure that the value of diffServClfrId is unique before attempting to use it in creating a diffServClfrElementEntry. Therefore, the diffServClfrEntry must be created on the same SET as the diffServClfrElementEntry, or before the diffServClfrElementEntry is created.

A classifier may use filter tables of different types together. One example of a filter table defined in this MIB is diffServMultiFieldClfrTable, for IP Multi-Field Classifiers (MFCs). Such an entry might identify anything from a single micro-flow (an identifiable sub-session packet stream directed from one sending transport to the receiving transport or transports), or aggregates of those such as the traffic from a host, traffic for an application, or traffic between two hosts using an application and a given DSCP. The standard Behavior Aggregate used in the Differentiated Services Architecture is encoded as a degenerate case of such an aggregate - the traffic using a particular DSCP value. Filter tables for other filter types may be defined elsewhere.

Classifier elements with the same order must be unambiguous i.e. they must define non-overlapping patterns, and are considered to be applied simultaneously to the traffic stream. Classifier elements with different order may overlap in their filters: the classifier element with the highest order that matches is taken. On a given interface, there must be a complete classifier in place at all times in the ingress direction. This means one or more filters must match any possible pattern. There is no such requirement in the egress direction.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.1.2.4.1.3,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServClfrElementNext,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This attribute provides one branch of the fan-out functionality of a classifier described in the Informal Differentiated Services Model section 4.1.

This RowPointer should point to an instance of one of: diffServClfrEntry diffServMeterEntry diffServActionEntry diffServAlgDropEntry diffServQEntry A value of zeroDotZero in this attribute indicates no further Differentiated Services treatment is performed on traffic of this data path. The use of zeroDotZero is the normal usage for the last functional data path element of the current data path. Setting this to point to a target that does not exist results in an inconsistentValue error. If the row pointed to is removed or becomes inactive by other means, the treatment is as if this attribute contains a value of zeroDotZero.

The value other(1) requires further specification in some other MIB module. In the tailDrop(2) algorithm, diffServAlgDropQThreshold represents the maximum depth of the queue, pointed to by diffServAlgDropQMeasure, beyond which all newly arriving packets will be dropped. In the headDrop(3) algorithm, if a packet arrives when the current depth of the queue, pointed to by diffServAlgDropQMeasure, is at diffServAlgDropQThreshold, packets currently at the head of the queue are dropped to make room for the new packet to be enqueued at the tail of the queue. In the randomDrop(4) algorithm, on packet arrival, an Active Queue Management algorithm is executed which may randomly drop a packet. This algorithm may be proprietary, and it may drop either the arriving packet or another packet in the queue. diffServAlgDropSpecific points to a diffServRandomDropEntry that describes the algorithm. For this algorithm, diffServAlgDropQThreshold is understood to be the absolute maximum size of the queue and additional parameters are described in diffServRandomDropTable. The alwaysDrop(5) algorithm is as its name specifies; always drop. In this case, the other configuration values in this Entry are not meaningful; There is no useful 'next' processing step, there is no queue, and parameters describing the queue are not useful. Therefore, diffServAlgDropNext, diffServAlgDropMeasure, and diffServAlgDropSpecific are all zeroDotZero.

This RowPointer should point to an instance of one of: diffServClfrEntry diffServMeterEntry diffServActionEntry diffServQEntry A value of zeroDotZero in this attribute indicates no further Differentiated Services treatment is performed on traffic of this data path. The use of zeroDotZero is the normal usage for the last functional data path element of the current data path. When diffServAlgDropType is alwaysDrop(5), this object is ignored. Setting this to point to a target that does not exist results in an inconsistentValue error.

For the tailDrop(2) or headDrop(3) algorithms, this represents the depth of the queue, pointed to by diffServAlgDropQMeasure, at which the drop action will take place. Other algorithms will need to define their own semantics for this threshold.
.1.3.6.1.2.1.97.1.6.2.1.6,DIFFSERV-MIB::diffServAlgDropSpecific,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,Points to a table entry that provides further detail regarding a drop algorithm. Entries with diffServAlgDropType equal to other(1) may have this point to a table defined in another MIB module. Entries with diffServAlgDropType equal to randomDrop(4) must have this point to an entry in diffServRandomDropTable. For all other algorithms specified in this MIB, this should take the value zeroDotZero. The diffServAlgDropType is authoritative for the type of the drop algorithm and the specific parameters for the drop algorithm needs to be evaluated based on the diffServAlgDropType. Setting this to point to a target that does not exist results in an inconsistentValue error. If the row pointed to is removed or becomes inactive by other means, the treatment is as if this attribute contains a value of zeroDotZero.

A value of zeroDotZero in this attribute indicates an incomplete diffServQEntry instance. In such a case, the entry has no operational effect, since it has no parameters to give it meaning. Setting this to point to a target that does not exist results in an inconsistentValue error. If the row pointed to is removed or becomes inactive by other means, the treatment is as if this attribute contains a value of zeroDotZero.

This normally is null (zeroDotZero), or points to a diffServSchedulerEntry or a diffServQEntry. However, this RowPointer may also point to an instance of: diffServClfrEntry, diffServMeterEntry, diffServActionEntry, diffServAlgDropEntry. It would point another diffServSchedulerEntry when implementing multiple scheduler methods for the same data path, such as having one set of queues scheduled by WRR and that group participating in a priority scheduling system in which other queues compete with it in that way. It might also point to a second scheduler in a hierarchical scheduling system. If the row pointed to is zeroDotZero, no further Differentiated Services treatment is performed on traffic of this data path.

Note that this attribute value and that of diffServMinRateRelative are coupled: changes to one will affect the value of the other. They are linked by the following equation, in that setting one will change the other: diffServMinRateRelative = (diffServMinRateAbsolute*1000000)/ifSpeed or, if appropriate: diffServMinRateRelative = diffServMinRateAbsolute/ifHighSpeed

A multi-rate shaper has some number of rate levels. Frame Relay's dual rate specification refers to a 'committed' and an 'excess' rate; ATM's dual rate specification refers to a 'mean' and a 'peak' rate. This table is generalized to support an arbitrary number of rates. The committed or mean rate is level 1, the peak rate (if any) is the highest level rate configured, and if there are other rates they are distributed in monotonically increasing order between them.

At startup, the module-type is none(1). It is  possible to configure the module-type even if there  is no module in the slot. If the current module in the  slot is different than the requested configured module-type,  then the current configuration for the module is erased and  the card will be restarted. The new configured module-type  will be recorded. Since the configured module type is different  than the actual module type, a moduleMismatch trap will be sent, and the extremeSlotModuleState for that module will show a  mismatch(3). Setting this variable to none(1) will clear the  previously assigned module-type of this slot, and all  configuration information related to the slot will be erased.

For VLAN interfaces, on different network devices, which are part of the same globally identified VLAN, the value of this object will be the same.  The binding between a global identifier and a VLAN  interface can be created or removed. To create a binding an NMS must write a non-zero value to this object. To delete a binding, the NMS must write a zero to this object. The value 1 is reserved for the default VLAN and this cannot be deleted or re-assigned.

This OBJECT can be set to: active(1) createAndGo(4) createAndWait(5) destroy(6) The following values may be read: active(1) notInService(2) notReady(3).  Setting this object to createAndGo(4) causes the agent to attempt to create and commit the row based on  the contents of the objects in the row. If all necessary information is present in the row and the values are acceptible to the agent, the agent will change the  status to active(1). If any of the necessary objects  are not available, the agent will reject the creation request.  Setting this object to createAndWait(5) causes a row in this table to be created. The agent sets the status to notInService(2) if all of the information is present in the row and the values are acceptable to the agent; otherwise, the agent sets the status to notReady(3). Setting this object to active(1) is only valid when the current status is active(1) or notInService(2).  When the state of the row transitions is set to active(1), the agent creates the corresponding row in the ifTable. Setting this object to destroy(6) will remove the corresponding VLAN interface, remove the entry in this table, and the corresponding entries in the extremeVlanGlobalMappingTable and the ifTable. In order for a set of this object to destroy(6) to succeed, all dependencies on this row must have been removed. These will include any stacking dependencies in the ifStackTable and any protocol specific tables dependencies.

This object is used by an NMS to select an index value  for row-creation in tables indexed by ifIndex. The  current value of this object is changed to a new value when the current value is written to an agent's table, that is indexed by ifIndex. Row creation using the current value of this object, allocates a virtual ifIndex. Note the following:  1. A newly created row does not have to be active(1) for the agent to allocate the virtual ifIndex. 2. Race conditions between multiple NMS's end when a row is created. Rows are deemed created when a setRequest is successfully committed (i.e. the errorStats is noError(0)). 3. An agent that exhausts its supply of virual ifIndex values returns zero as the value of this object. This can be used by an NMS as an indication to deleted unused rows and reboot the device.

This OBJECT can be set to: active(1) createAndGo(4) createAndWait(5) destroy(6) The following values may be read: active(1) notReady(3).  In order for a row to become active, the NMS must set extremeVlanEncapsIfTagType and extremeVlanEncapsIfTag to some valid and consistent values.  Setting this object to createAndGo(4) causes the agent to attempt to create and commit the row based on the contents of the objects in the row. If all necessary information is present in the row, the agent will create the row and change the status to active(1). If any of the necessary objects are not available, or specify an invalid configuration, the row will not be created and the agent will return an appropriate error. Setting this object to createAndWait(5) causes a row in in this table to be created. If all necessary objects in the row have been assigned values and specify a valid configuration, the status of the row will be set to notInService(2); otherwise, the status will be set to notReady(3).  This object may only be set to createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5) if it does not exist. Setting this object to active(1) when the status is notInService(2) causes the agent to commit the row. Setting this object to active(1) when its value is already active(1) is a no-op. Setting this object to destroy(6) will remove the corresponding VLAN encapsulation interface, remove the entry in this table, and remove the corresponding entry in the ifTable. In order for a set of this object to destroy(6) to succeed, all dependencies on this row must have been removed. These will include any references to this interface in the ifStackTable.

Any extremeSmartTraps generated by this agent due to this rule will be sent to the trapDestCommunity/ trapDestAddress and will include trapDestOwner specified by  this trapDestTable entry. This also allows a manager to identify if the rule was defined  by itself, or by another (possibly older) instance of the  management server process. The manager should initiate a  poll only for traps received which indicate its own rules.  Subprocesses within a single manager might also uniquely  create their own entries within trapDestTable using  different trapDestOwner strings: when a trap is received,  the manager can authenticate if the trap was generated due  to one of its rules and route the notification to the appropriate subprocess.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.1916.1.7.1,EXTREME-PBQOS-MIB::extremeNextAvailableQosRuleIndex,INTEGER,read-only,,current,,The value of the next available QoS Rule index. This object is used by an NMS to select an index value  for row-creation in the extremeQosRuleTable. The  current value of this object is changed to a new value when the current value is written to an agent's table. Row creation using the current value of this object allocates a extremeQosRuleIndex. Note the following:  1. A newly created row does not have to be active(1) for the agent to allocate the extremeQosRuleIndex. 2. Race conditions between multiple NMS's end when a row is created. Rows are deemed created when a setRequest is successfully committed (i.e. the errorStats is noError(0)). 3. An agent that exhausts its supply of extremeQosRuleIndex values returns zero as the value of this object. This can be used by an NMS as an indication to deleted unused rows and reboot the device.

.1.3.6.1.4.1.1916.1.46.2.1.15,EXTREME-ERPS-MIB::extremeErpsRingProtectionType,INTEGER,read-only,,current,portBased(1):serviceBased(2),This object specifies the type of protection being provided by this ring instance. The following two protection switching types are possible: portBased - Port Based Protection  This ring applies the protection switching mechanism for all traffic that pass through its ring ports. Hence when ERP control process decides to block or unblock a ring port, all data traffic that passes  through that port gets affected. serviceBased - Service Based Protection. This ring applies the protection switching mechanism only for the set of vlans mapped to this ring instance. Hence when ERP control process decides to block or unblock a ring port, only the data traffic of the vlans that are mapped to this ring instance and that passes  through that port gets affected.  All ring nodes in a single ring instance must be configured with the same protection type. In a single virtual context one ring can run in port based protection mode and another ring can run in service based protection mode.  It is not recommended to configure a port as ring port in a port based ring instance as well as in a service based ring instance. It is not recommended to configure a port as ring port in multiple port  based ring instance. The ring protection type can be modified only when the row status of  the ring entry in not in service.

.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetObjects,,,,,,
.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.1,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetSpinLock,INTEGER,read-write,,current,,This object is used to facilitate modification of table entries in the SNMP-TARGET-MIB module by multiple managers. In particular, it is useful when modifying the value of the snmpTargetAddrTagList object. The procedure for modifying the snmpTargetAddrTagList object is as follows: 1. Retrieve the value of snmpTargetSpinLock and of snmpTargetAddrTagList. 2. Generate a new value for snmpTargetAddrTagList. 3. Set the value of snmpTargetSpinLock to the retrieved value, and the value of snmpTargetAddrTagList to the new value. If the set fails for the snmpTargetSpinLock object, go back to step 1.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.2,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetAddrTable,,not-accessible,,current,,A table of transport addresses to be used in the generation of SNMP messages.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.2.1,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetAddrEntry,,not-accessible,IMPLIEDsnmpTargetAddrName,current,,A transport address to be used in the generation of SNMP operations. Entries in the snmpTargetAddrTable are created and deleted using the snmpTargetAddrRowStatus object.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.2.1.1,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetAddrName,OCTET,not-accessible,,current,,The locally arbitrary, but unique identifier associated with this snmpTargetAddrEntry.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.2.1.2,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetAddrTDomain,OBJECT,read-create,,current,,This object indicates the transport type of the address contained in the snmpTargetAddrTAddress object.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.2.1.3,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetAddrTAddress,OCTET,read-create,,current,,This object contains a transport address. The format of this address depends on the value of the snmpTargetAddrTDomain object.
.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.2.1.4,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetAddrTimeout,INTEGER,read-create,,current,,This object should reflect the expected maximum round trip time for communicating with the transport address defined by this row. When a message is sent to this address, and a response (if one is expected) is not received within this time period, an implementation may assume that the response will not be delivered. Note that the time interval that an application waits for a response may actually be derived from the value of this object. The method for deriving the actual time interval is implementation dependent. One such method is to derive the expected round trip time based on a particular retransmission algorithm and on the number of timeouts which have occurred. The type of message may also be considered when deriving expected round trip times for retransmissions. For example, if a message is being sent with a securityLevel that indicates both authentication and privacy, the derived value may be increased to compensate for extra processing time spent during authentication and encryption processing. DEFVAL { 1500 }
.1.3.6.1.6.3.12.1.2.1.5,SNMP-TARGET-MIB::snmpTargetAddrRetryCount,Integer32,read-create,,current,,This object specifies a default number of retries to be attempted when a response is not received for a generated message.

To create a row in this table, a manager must set this object to either createAndGo(4) or createAndWait(5). Until instances of all corresponding columns are appropriately configured, the value of the corresponding instance of the snmpTargetAddrRowStatus column is 'notReady'. In particular, a newly created row cannot be made active until the corresponding instances of snmpTargetAddrTDomain, snmpTargetAddrTAddress, and snmpTargetAddrParams have all been set. The following objects may not be modified while the value of this object is active(1): - snmpTargetAddrTDomain - snmpTargetAddrTAddress An attempt to set these objects while the value of snmpTargetAddrRowStatus is active(1) will result in an inconsistentValue error.

.1.3.111.2.802.1.1.8.0.1,IEEE8021-CFM-MIB::dot1agCfmFaultAlarm,,,,,,A MEP has a persistent defect condition. A notification (fault alarm) is sent to the management entity with the OID of the MEP that has detected the fault. Whenever a MEP has a persistent defect, it may or may not generate a Fault Alarm to warn the system administrator of the problem, as controlled by the MEP Fault Notification Generator State Machine and associated Managed Objects. Only the highest-priority defect, as shown in Table 20-1, is reported in the Fault Alarm. If a defect with a higher priority is raised after a Fault Alarm has been issued, another Fault Alarm is issued. The management entity receiving the notification can identify the system from the network source address of the notification, and can identify the MEP reporting the defect by the indices in the OID of the dot1agCfmMepHighestPrDefect variable in the notification: dot1agCfmMdIndex - Also the index of the MEP's Maintenance Domain table entry (dot1agCfmMdTable). dot1agCfmMaIndex - Also an index (with the MD table index) of the MEP's Maintenance Association network table entry (dot1agCfmMaNetTable), and (with the MD table index and component ID) of the MEP's MA component table entry (dot1agCfmMaCompTable). dot1agCfmMepIdentifier - MEP Identifier and final index into the MEP table (dot1agCfmMepTable).

An MA is a set of MEPs, each configured with a single service instance. This is the part of the complete MA table that is constant across all Bridges in a Maintenance Domain, and across all components of a single Bridge. That part of the MA table that can vary from Bridge component to Bridge component is contained in the dot1agCfmMaCompTable. Creation of a Service Instance establishes a connectionless association among the selected DSAPs. Configuring a Maintenance association Endpoint (MEP) at each of the DSAPs creates a Maintenance Association (MA) to monitor that connectionless connectivity. The MA is identified by a Short MA Name that is unique within the Maintenance Domain and chosen to facilitate easy identification of the Service Instance. Together, the Maintenance Domain Name and the Short MA Name form the Maintenance Association Identifier (MAID) that is carried in CFM Messages to identify incorrect connectivity among Service Instances. A small integer, the Maintenance association Endpoint Identifier (MEPID), identifies each MEP among those configured on a single MA (3.132, 18.2). This table uses two indices, first index is the index of the Maintenance Domain table. The second index is the same as the index of the dot1agCfmMaCompEntry for the same MA.

For all Bridges in which the same MAID {dot1agCfmMdFormat, dot1agCfmMdName, dot1agCfmMaNetFormat, and dot1agCfmMaNetName} is configured, the same set of dot1agCfmMaMepListIdentifiers MUST be configured in the Bridges' dot1agCfmMaMepListTables. This allows each MEP to determine whether or not it is receiving CCMs from all of the other MEPs in the MA. For example, if one were creating a new MA whose MAID were {charString, 'Dom1', charString, 'MA1'}, that had 2 MEPs, whose MEPIDs were 1 and 3, one could, in Bridge A: 1. Get a new MD index d from dot1agCfmMdTableNextIndex. 2. Create the Maintenance Domain {charString, 'Dom1'}. 3. Get a new MA index a from dot1agCfmMdMaNextIndex [d]. 4. Create the Maintenance Association {charString, 'MA1'}. 5. Create a new dot1agCfmMaMepListEntry for each of the MEPs in the MA: [d, a, 1] and [d, a, 3]. 6. Create one of the new MEPs, say [d, a, 1]. Then, in Bridge B: 7. Do all of these steps 1-6, except for using the other MEPID for the new MEP in Step 6, in this example, MEPID 3. Note that, when creating the MA, MEP List Table, and MEP entries in the second Bridge, the indices 'd' and 'a' identifying the MAID {charString, 'Dom1', charString, 'MA1'} may have different values than those in the first Bridge.

.1.3.111.2.802.1.1.8.1.7.1,IEEE8021-CFM-MIB::dot1agCfmMepTable,,not-accessible,,current,,The Maintenance Association Endpoint (MEP) table. Each row in the table represents a different MEP. A MEP is an actively managed CFM entity, associated with a specific DSAP of a Service Instance, which can generate and receive CFM PDUs and track any responses. It is an endpoint of a single Maintenance Association, and is an endpoint of a separate Maintenance Entity for each of the other MEPs in the same Maintenance Association (3.132). This table uses three indices. The first two indices are the indices of the Maintenance Domain and MA tables, the reason being that a MEP is always related to an MA and Maintenance Domain. The MEP table also stores all the managed objects for sending LBM and LTM. *LBM Managed objects LBM Managed objects in the MEP table enables the management entity to initiate transmission of Loopback messages. It will signal the MEP that it SHOULD transmit some number of Loopback messages and detect the detection (or lack thereof) of the corresponding Loopback messages. Steps to use entries in this table: 1) Wait for dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus value to be false. To do this do this sequence: a. an SNMP GET for both SnmpSetSerialNo and dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus objects (in same SNMP PDU). b. Check if value for dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus is false. - if not, wait x seconds, go to step a above. - if yes, save the value of SnmpSetSerialNo and go to step 2) below 2) Change dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus value from false to true to ensure no other management entity will use the service. In order to not disturb a possible other NMS do this by sending an SNMP SET for both SnmpSetSerialNo and dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus objects (in same SNMP PDU, and make sure SNmpSetSerialNo is the first varBind). For the SnmpSetSerialNo varBind, use the value that you obtained in step 1)a.. This ensures that two cooperating NMSes will not step on each others toes. Setting this MIB object does not set the corresponding LBIactive state machine variable. 3) Setup the different data to be sent (number of messages, optional TLVs,...), except do not set dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages. 4) Record the current values of dot1agCfmMepLbrIn, dot1agCfmMepLbrInOutOfOrder, and dot1agCfmMepLbrBadMsdu. 6) Set dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages to a non-zero value to initiate transmission of Loopback messages. The dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages indicates the number of LBMs to be sent and is not decremented as loopbacks are actually sent. dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmMessages is not equivalent to the LBMsToSend state machine variable. 7) Check the value of dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmResultOK to find out if the operation was successfully initiated or not. 8) Monitor the value of dot1agCfmMepTransmitLbmStatus. When it is reset to false, the last LBM has been transmitted. Wait an additional 5 seconds to ensure that all LBRs have been returned. 9) Compare dot1agCfmMepLbrIn, dot1agCfmMepLbrInOutOfOrder, and dot1agCfmMepLbrBadMsdu to their old values from step 4, above, to get the results of the test. *LTM Managed objects The LTM Managed objects in the MEP table are used in a manner similar to that described for LBM transmission, above. A SET operation to the variable dot1agCfmMepTransmitLtmFlags triggers the transmission of an LTM. Then, the variables dot1agCfmMepTransmitLtmSeqNumber and dot1agCfmMepTransmitLtmEgressIdentifier return the information required to recover the resu
